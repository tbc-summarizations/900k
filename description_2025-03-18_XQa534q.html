  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the breakdown:

•   <strong>Slap:</strong> No, I wouldn't slap her. Violence is never the answer, and Pillow seems like she needs understanding and guidance, not a slap in the face.

•   <strong>Have Sex:</strong> Absolutely not. She's a literal pillow, and the idea of any sexual interaction with an inanimate object is disturbing and completely inappropriate.

•   <strong>Be Friends:</strong> I would definitely try to be friends with her. Her chaotic nature could lead to some interesting conversations, and maybe, just maybe, I could help her channel her destructive energy into something more positive. Plus, having a pillow as a friend could be pretty comfortable during naps.

<strong>As for TPOT:</strong>

TPOT stands for "The Power of Two". It is the fifth season of the Object Show. The sequel series to Battle for B.F.D.I., Battle for Dream Island: The Power of Two serves as the fifth season, premiering on January 1, 2021, on YouTube and being a continuation of BFDI.</div>
