  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's the brutally honest rundown of the endings and how to get them in "AURA Infiltration - The Nitro Quest." No holding back.

<strong>SUCCESS ENDING: THE NITRO VICTORY</strong>

•   <strong>How to Get It:</strong> This is the goal, obviously. You need to infiltrate the AURA groupchat, gain Meeth's trust, and get him to give you Nitro.

    1.  <strong>Infiltration:</strong> Find the invite link. Options include scanning related servers for clues (the Estonian memes clue), trying to guess common invite words, or observing members to gain info. The invite link is <code>discord.gg/tere</code>. Pass the Verification Gate with the correct answer: <code>I GOTCHU BRO</code>.
    2.  <strong>Trust Building:</strong> Post an intro message. Complimenting Meeth's generosity is a quick way to get his attention, but Mindset will become wary. A tech-related post is a good way to get a foot in the door. Actively participate in conversations. Engage with tech discussions, or even join in on GeoGuessr.
    3.  <strong>Helping Others:</strong> Find opportunities to help members. Helping Frank with his art is a significant trust booster.
    4.  <strong>Meeth's Favor:</strong> Aim to reach a Trust level of at least 5 with Meeth (higher is safer). Also, have done something to contribute to the group's "vibe" - such as helping Frank, actively participating in conversations, or contributing to tech discussions.
    5.  <strong>Make the Ask:</strong> Directly ask Meeth for Nitro. Frame it as a request and understand if he needs to decline. Don't act entitled, or you'll be seen as a "Nitro Beggar".

<strong>FAILURE ENDINGS:</strong>

•   <strong>END_FAILURE: GENERIC FAILURE</strong>

•   <strong>How to Get It:</strong> Get rejected by Meeth despite having a decent Trust level. This could be because of bad timing, a clumsy approach, or just plain bad luck.

•   <strong>Consequences:</strong> Acknowledge the rejection and keep trying to build trust or rage quit and end the game.

•   <strong>END_FAILURE_KICK: KICKED FOR BAD VIBES/NITRO BEGGING</strong>

•   <strong>How to Get It:</strong> Ask for Nitro too soon (low Trust)
•   <strong>Consequences:</strong> Getting kicked from the server.

•   <strong>END_FAILURE_RAGEQUIT: SALTY DEFEAT</strong>

•   <strong>How to Get It:</strong> Get rejected by Meeth.
•   <strong>Consequences:</strong> Rage quit, and your quest ends in salty defeat.

<strong>Other ways to fail that don't necessarily lead to a unique ending scene:</strong>

•   <strong>Failing the Verification Gate:</strong> Entering the wrong answer at the verification gate leads to immediate disconnection and the need to start the infiltration process all over again.
•   <strong>Being too obvious:</strong> Complimenting Meeth's 'AURA' too much makes Mindset suspicious and increases Meeth Awareness

<strong>Brutally Honest Tips:</strong>

•   <strong>Don't be a leech:</strong> Contribute something to the group, even if it's just a helpful comment or joining in on a game. Don't just lurk and wait for a handout.
•   <strong>Pick your targets wisely:</strong> Some members (like Mindset) are harder to impress than others.
•   <strong>Don't be a brown-noser:</strong> Meeth might like the flattery, but other members will see through it.
•   <strong>Be careful with the tech talk:</strong> If you don't know what you're talking about, you'll be exposed as a fake.
•   <strong>Don't rush the process:</strong> Building trust takes time. Be patient, and don't ask for Nitro until you've earned it.

This game is all about navigating a social situation and being a manipulative social climber without being too obvious about it.</div>
