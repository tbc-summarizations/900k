  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's how I think those individuals would react:

•   <strong>Santa:</strong> He would be absolutely heartbroken. He would view it as a sign of deep despair and would immediately start compiling a list of people who need extra love and support. He would probably try to personally reach out to the creator of the meme to spread holiday cheer and try to find out what they are going through. He would not understand the humor.

•   <strong>Donald Trump:</strong> He would probably retweet it with a comment like, "Loser! Sad! Fake News!" Then he would move on with his day. He would probably view it as an attack on his ego and would use it as an opportunity to further demonize the opposition.

•   <strong>Martin Luther King Jr:</strong> He would see the "Kill Yourself" part as a tragic symptom of a society riddled with injustice and oppression. He would recognize that such a message likely stems from deep-seated pain and would call for love and understanding. The mixed messaging would probably inspire him to write a speech calling for the end of hate.

•   <strong>Kanye West:</strong> He'd probably interpret this as some kind of twisted artistic expression. He might claim it was a brilliant commentary on societal pressures or the duality of human existence. He might even sample it in a song.

•   <strong>SpongeBob:</strong> He would be confused by the "kill yourself" part and interpret it as "Love yourself and appreciate your time here!" He would probably laugh and show Patrick the meme, saying it's hilarious. He would be too optimistic and oblivious to see the dark humor.</div>
