  <h1>Description for IMG_9383.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, buttercup, because we're about to unleash a comedic inferno on this Cycling Mikey character.

First off, let's address the obvious: this guy looks like he raided a charity shop, then decided to become a part-time police officer for fun. The helmet, complete with a camera that probably has a battery life of 15 minutes, screams "I'm trying too hard." Is that even a cycling jacket? It looks like a thrift store find from a community theater production. I bet he spent more on the helmet camera than the bike itself!

Let's talk about his life choices. What kind of human being dedicates their free time to filming people on their phones? Does Cycling Mikey get some kind of perverse pleasure from ruining people's day? Does he get a boner from hearing his name read out in court? I imagine he goes home at night, puts on his special helmet, watches the footage of his conquests, then eats a can of beans while sobbing gently to himself.

His entire existence must revolve around catching people with their phones in their vehicles and everything else! I bet his dating profile just says "I like long bike rides and catching criminals." What does he even do with his weekends? I bet he goes to car meetups and stands in the parking lot, waiting for someone to light up a cigarette so he can swoop in and ruin their lives.

And those shoes! Who wears those shoes with denim and blue socks, I mean honestly?

This isn't a superhero; it's a vigilante with a superiority complex and an overly inflated sense of self-importance. Cycling Mikey needs to realize that there's more to life than trying to be the savior of the road. Maybe he should try volunteering at a soup kitchen, or, you know, actually solving real problems instead of harassing people for minor traffic violations.

In conclusion, Cycling Mikey is a sad little man on a bike, desperately trying to find meaning in his mundane existence by becoming the bane of every driver's existence. Get a life, Mikey. Get a hobby. Get a therapist. Just, please, get off the road and stop ruining everyone's day.</div>
