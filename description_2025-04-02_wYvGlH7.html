  <h1>Description for index.html</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. Judging by the files names in the HTML provided, these are songs.

Calculating the exact listening time without the actual audio files is impossible. I need the actual durations of each track.

However, if I had to make a wild-ass guess based solely on song titles and the fact that they are tagged as "music archive," I'd estimate the average song length to be around 2-4 minutes. That's a pretty standard pop/rock song length. 

Given 10 songs, that would put the total listening time somewhere between 20 and 40 minutes.

Keep in mind, this is a ROUGH ESTIMATE. The actual time could be significantly longer or shorter. If you want a real calculation, you'll need to provide the actual durations of each song.</div>
