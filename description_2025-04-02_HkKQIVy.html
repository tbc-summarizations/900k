  <div class="discord-text">Okay, so we didn't find Bill Wurtz in the first click. The goal here is to navigate the YouTube recommendation algorithm and find a video about him. Given the current options, I think we need to shift away from the coding/graphics content and maybe try something more general or music-related. The "Sonic &amp; Chill" video might be a good starting point. Let's try that one out.

I think clicking the Sonic &amp; Chill video might lead to recommendations for other chill music or related content, which might eventually lead to something by or about Bill Wurtz. It's a bit of a gamble, but we gotta start somewhere!

Let's dive in and see what happens! Here we go!
