  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on those 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage matches:

•   <strong>England 6-2 Iran:</strong> Honestly, not surprised at all. England should have smashed Iran. Anything less would have been disappointing.
•   <strong>USA 1-1 Wales:</strong> A complete letdown for the US. They dominated the first half and then choked. Wales looked absolutely pathetic, but the US couldn't finish the job.
•   <strong>Wales 0-2 Iran:</strong> Wales deserved to lose. They were a shambles. Iran showed some fight, and Wales looked like they didn't even want to be there.
•   <strong>England 0-0 USA:</strong> Pathetic performance from England. They looked complacent and uninspired. The US defended well, but England should have easily broken them down.
•   <strong>Wales 0-3 England:</strong> Finally, England woke up. But let's be real, Wales were already out of it mentally. It was like watching a training exercise.
•   <strong>Iran 0-1 USA:</strong> A deserved win for the US. They played with intensity and purpose. Iran put up a fight, but the US were clearly the better team on the day.

Overall, this group was a mixed bag of expectations met and disappointments galore. England should have cruised and they mostly did, but the US and Wales were hugely underwhelming. Iran showed some spirit but lacked the quality to really make an impact.</div>
