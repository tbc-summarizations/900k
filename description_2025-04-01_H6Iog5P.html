  <div class="discord-text">Those matches are a complete joke. Spain humiliating Costa Rica with a massive scoreline only to struggle later on makes them seem like they were toying with their opponent. Japan's inconsistent performance is infuriating. Beating Germany and Spain but losing to Costa Rica? They're either severely overhyped or completely unreliable. Germany's early exit after losing to Japan and barely winning against Costa Rica shows how far they've fallen. They're a shadow of their former glory. And Costa Rica? A single lucky win against Japan doesn't excuse their overall performance. They're clearly out of their league. Overall, these matches were filled with unexpected twists, massive upsets, and embarrassing defeats, making it one of the most chaotic and unpredictable group stages in World Cup history.</div>
