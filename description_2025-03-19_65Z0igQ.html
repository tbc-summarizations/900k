  <div class="discord-text">Okay, so, your friend's first gameplay video… Brutal honesty? Here it is.

<strong>The Good:</strong>
•   The premise is a decent idea.
•   There's a sense of humour, for sure, even if it's a bit raw.

<strong>The Bad (and what to fix):</strong>
•   <strong>Technical Nightmares:</strong> The phone notifications and the constant app crashing is abysmal. Your friend NEEDS to fix their phone or play on a different device. No one will watch a video that's constantly interrupted. The lag also sucks.
•   <strong>Commentary:</strong> The commentary is inconsistent. There are random insults thrown at other players, and it's not even funny.
•   <strong>The "Joke":</strong> If the joke is that his phone is constantly malfunctioning then it's a bad joke as it also makes the gameplay worse.

<strong>Overall:</strong>
This has potential, but your friend needs to address the technical issues and refine their commentary. Right now, it's a mess that's hard to watch.</div>
