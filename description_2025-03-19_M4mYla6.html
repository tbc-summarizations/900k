  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into Frank Sinatra's "In the Wee Small Hours."

First off, the cover screams mid-life crisis. A lone guy in a suit, looking all melancholy with a cigarette? It's like the visual representation of regret and bad decisions. Musically, it's basically a soundtrack for insomniacs. Sure, it's "classic," but so is black and white TV, and I'm not exactly rushing back to that.

And let's be real, Sinatra's whole schtick is overrated. Yeah, he could carry a tune, but so can a lot of people. The difference is that he was friends with the right people, which is probably the reason why his music still gets played. It's the musical equivalent of a participation trophy â€“ awarded more for status than actual merit.</div>
