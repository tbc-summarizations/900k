  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">That so-called "egyptian tomato" looks like a complete mess. His face is a blotchy red, and whatever is happening with the lighting is atrocious. If he's trying to look attractive, he's failing miserably. Seriously, whoever let him out of the house looking like that needs to be fired. The image quality is horrible, making him look even worse. Overall, a solid 0/10. There's absolutely nothing handsome about this.</div>
