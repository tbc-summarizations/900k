  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because we're diving deep into the toilet to figure out how to get every single goddamn ending in this game. No holding back, just the straight, unflushed truth.

Here's the roadmap to your glorious (or disgusting) victory:

<strong>Core Mechanics to Exploit</strong>

•   <strong>Flush Count:</strong> This is your primary manipulation tool. Control how many times you flush.
•   <strong>Toilet State:</strong> Exploded or normal. Blow it up for some endings, keep it pristine for others.
•   <strong>Plunger:</strong> Find it, use it (or don't), and let your decisions guide you.
•   <strong>Special Item:</strong> Find it, use it (or don't). This is crucial for specific endings.
•   <strong>Health:</strong> Manage both your health and the boss's health.

<strong>The Endings - A Step-by-Step Guide</strong>

1.  <strong>Disaster Ending: You exploded the toilet in a fit of rage.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet 10 or more times. The toilet MUST explode. Don't start the final boss fight by making it not trigger 3 times.
•   Leave game.
2.  <strong>Careful Ending: One flush and done, a responsible citizen.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet exactly once.
•   Leave game.
3.  <strong>Risky but Caring Ending: You flirted with disaster but showed restraint.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet 9 times. Almost at exploding but don't flush again. The toilet MUST NOT explode.
•   Leave game.
4.  <strong>Plunger's Regret Ending: You found a plunger but left without using it, a missed opportunity.</strong>

•   Find the plunger (random chance).
•   Do NOT use the plunger at any point, even if the toilet explodes.
•   Flush as many times as you want.
•   Leave game.
5.  <strong>The Unflushed Ending: You came, you saw, you didn't flush. Why bother?</strong>

•   Do NOT flush the toilet at all.
•   Leave game.
6.  <strong>Casual Flusher Ending: A few flushes, then boredom. You're easily distracted.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet 2-3 times.
•   Leave game.
7.  <strong>Persistent Flusher Ending: You flushed a fair bit, showing some commitment to... flushing.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet 4-6 times.
•   Leave game.
8.  <strong>Edge of Chaos Ending: You pushed the toilet to its limits but backed off. A true tease.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet 7-8 times.
•   Leave game.
9. <strong>Special Item Unused Ending: You found a rare item, pondered its use, then... nothing. Intriguing inaction.</strong>

•  Have the special item
•  Do not use the special item
•  Leave game
10. <strong>Health Neglect Ending: Ignoring your own well-being to flush a toilet? Priorities, man!</strong>

• Flush as much as you can until health is below 20.
• Leave game
11. <strong>Premature Boss Evader Ending: You triggered boss potential but ran. Cowardly or wise?</strong>

• Have the boss fight count at least once. This can be done by exploding the toilet.
• Leave game before triggering the final boss.
12. <strong>Standard Departure Ending: You flushed, you left. The mundane path.</strong>

•   Flush the toilet a few times (not enough for other specific endings, like exploding it).
•   Leave game.
13. <strong>Defeated by the Toilet Monster! Plumbing prevails, you do not. Flushed Away Ending.</strong>

• Start boss fight by exploding the toilet three times to initiate final boss fight.
• Lose to the final boss fight. Make sure your health gets to 0.
• Game Over.
14. <strong>You vanquished the Toilet Monster! The plumbing is safe thanks to you!</strong>

• Start boss fight by exploding the toilet three times to initiate final boss fight.
• Win the final boss fight by getting the boss's health to 0.
• You win!

<strong>Important Notes</strong>

•   <strong>Random Events:</strong> The plunger and special item are random. You might need to restart the game multiple times to get them. Just keep flushing and leaving until they show up.
•   <strong>No Room for Error:</strong> Follow the instructions <em>exactly</em>. If you flush one too many times, you'll screw up the ending.

There you have it. Every single ending, laid out for you like a turd in a punchbowl. Now go, flush, and conquer that porcelain throne. And remember, wash your hands afterward.</div>
