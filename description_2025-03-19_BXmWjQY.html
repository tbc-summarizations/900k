  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up. Here's my take on those albums, no holds barred:

*<em>1. Hulk Hogan - </em>Frank Sinatra Sang by Nesktek**<em>

This album is a glorious trainwreck of ambition and pure, unadulterated madness. Who in their right mind would combine the spirit of Hulk Hogan, the crooning of Sinatra, and the sonic terrorism of Nesktek? Only a genius, that's who. </em>Frank Sinatra Sang by Nesktek<em> isn't just an album; it's a statement. A statement that says, "I reject your limitations, I spit in the face of genre, and I will create something so bizarre it transcends understanding and becomes art."

The post-rock elements provide a foundation of swirling guitars and atmospheric textures, creating a sense of epic scale. Then, the experimental rock kicks in, throwing curveballs of dissonance and unpredictable rhythms that keep you constantly on edge. And, oh god, the noise rock. It's like Nesktek decided to weaponize feedback and distortion, creating a sonic landscape that is both terrifying and exhilarating.

But the real magic is the way these disparate elements somehow coalesce. It's like watching a car crash in slow motion â€“ you know it's going to be a disaster, but you can't look away. The sheer audacity of the concept, combined with the skill of the musicians involved, makes for an album that is truly unforgettable. It's the kind of record that you'll either love or hate, but either way, you won't be able to stop talking about it. This is a 100/100 for a reason; it's not just music, it's a goddamn experience.

</em><em>2. Tom MacDonald - </em>I have negative nine hundred ninety nine eye vision out of twenty**<em>

Okay, listen, I know Tom MacDonald gets a lot of flak, and for good reason. But </em>I have negative nine hundred ninety nine eye vision out of twenty<em> is a surprisingly introspective and emotionally raw album. The title alone is enough to make you wonder what the hell you're getting into, and the music doesn't disappoint.

While MacDonald's usual political and social commentary is toned down here, what emerges is a vulnerability that is genuinely compelling. His lyrics are sharp and honest, exploring themes of self-doubt, disillusionment, and the struggle to find meaning in a world that often feels chaotic and absurd. The chamber folk arrangements are beautifully crafted, with delicate acoustic guitars, soaring strings, and melancholic melodies that perfectly complement the album's introspective mood.

Look, I'm not going to pretend that this album is going to change the world. It's still Tom MacDonald, after all. But if you're willing to look past the baggage and approach this album with an open mind, you might be surprised by what you find. It's a flawed but ultimately rewarding listen that shows a different side of an artist who is often unfairly pigeonholed.

</em><em>3. Miles Davis - </em>I FAKED MY DEATH**<em>

Miles Davis faked his death? What? This album title is an absolute masterstroke of marketing. But the music is just as genius. </em>I FAKED MY DEATH<em> is Miles Davis pushing the boundaries of Art-Pop and Electronic Dance Music.

The Art Pop elements are evident in the album's experimental song structures and emphasis on atmosphere and texture. Davis incorporates elements of jazz improvisation and modal harmonies, but they are filtered through a modern lens. The electronic dance music elements add a sense of immediacy and energy to the album. The throbbing basslines, shimmering synthesizers, and syncopated beats create a sonic landscape that is both hypnotic and exhilarating. Davis's trumpet playing is as virtuosic and expressive as ever. He's not afraid to experiment with new sounds and techniques, pushing his instrument to its limits.

</em><em>4. Playboi Carti - </em>Oh my god im vibrating**<em>

Alright, let's dive into the chaotic world of Playboi Carti with </em>Oh my god im vibrating<em>. This album is the embodiment of raw, unfiltered energy, a sonic assault on the senses that is both exhilarating and exhausting. Carti has cemented his place as a king of experimental trap with this release. The post-rock elements are evident in the album's distorted guitars, feedback-drenched textures, and unconventional song structures. Carti's vocals are often heavily processed, adding to the album's sense of sonic overload.

The Art Rock elements bring a level of experimentation and boundary-pushing that sets Carti apart from his contemporaries. He's not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of what's considered "acceptable" in the world of rap music. </em>Oh my god im vibrating* is not an album for the faint of heart. It's a challenging and often abrasive listen that demands your full attention. But if you're willing to surrender to its chaotic energy, you might just find yourself vibrating along with it.</div>
