  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the brutal truth about your zombie game:

<strong>What Sucks:</strong>

•   <strong>Graphics:</strong> They're utterly basic. Rectangles for players, zombies, and bullets? This looks like a prototype from the 1980s. It screams "lack of effort" visually. It's functional, but visually repulsive.
•   <strong>Sound:</strong> No actual sound files? Just console logs for "playing gunshot?" That's pathetic. Sound is half the experience in a zombie game, and you've neutered it.
•   <strong>Upgrade Menu:</strong> The text on the upgrade menu is unclear and the close button looks the same as the upgrades and gets lost.
•   <strong>Zombie AI:</strong> The zombies mindlessly beeline for the player. No variation, no pathfinding around obstacles, just a straight line. It's boring and predictable. They also clip each other which looks terrible.
•   <strong>"Difficulty":</strong> The difficulty increases too slowly, and the main things affected are the zombie spawn rate and health. It's also not very difficult.
•   <strong>Shooting:</strong> You can walk and shoot at the same time. There is no recoil or anything that affects your player while shooting.
•   <strong>Overall Lack of Polish:</strong> Everything feels rough around the edges. The transitions between screens are jarring, the UI is bland, and the entire experience lacks a sense of immersion.
•   <strong>Player movement</strong>: The player is jittery and the rotation is choppy.

<strong>What's Passable (But Needs Work):</strong>

•   <strong>Core Gameplay Loop:</strong> The basic shoot-zombies-to-survive is there. It's a foundation, but a very, very basic one. It's a dime a dozen mechanic with no interesting twist.
•   <strong>Upgrades:</strong> The upgrade system <em>could</em> be a compelling progression mechanic, but right now, it's just stat boosts. It needs more interesting upgrades that change gameplay.
•   <strong>Game States:</strong> You have a title screen, game over, etc., which is good structure. However, the screens themselves are awful to look at.

<strong>Overall Verdict:</strong>

As it stands, your game is a <strong>barebones, uninspired, and frankly, visually offensive</strong>. It has the <em>very</em> basic elements of a zombie shooter, but it's nowhere near a "good" game. It needs a complete visual overhaul, significantly improved AI, compelling sound design, and a far more engaging upgrade system. Right now, it feels like a programming exercise, not a game.

This may sound harsh, but it's honest. If you want to make a game that people will actually <em>enjoy</em>, you need to put in a <em>lot</em> more effort.</div>
