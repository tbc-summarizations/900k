  <div class="discord-text">(Verse 1)
Boring Club, yeah, that's the crew
Mindset's always preaching, got no clue
AdamMady, quiet type, just scrolls along
AJ Transport Hub, always singing the same old song

(Chorus)
Boring Club, Boring Club, filled with sleepy heads
Andrejtb's got memes, but they're already dead
BDYT, Finomano, HappyManOfficial too
Another day, another dull view

(Verse 2)
HenryTheKazakh, I don't know what to say
Meethexep lurking, gone MIA
Salle's the worst, always trying to stir
But nobody cares, just a boring blur

(Chorus)
Boring Club, Boring Club, filled with sleepy heads
Andrejtb's got memes, but they're already dead
BDYT, Finomano, HappyManOfficial too
Another day, another dull view

(Bridge)
No drama, no spice, just the same old routine
This group chat's the death of everything I've seen

(Chorus)
Boring Club, Boring Club, filled with sleepy heads
Andrejtb's got memes, but they're already dead
BDYT, Finomano, HappyManOfficial too
Another day, another dull view

(Outro)
Boring Club, yeah, it's a snore
I'd rather do anything, even scrub the floor</div>
