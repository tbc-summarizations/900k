  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's how you can set up the timer to automatically cut off the electricity to your scooter charger:

<strong>1. Set the Current Time and Day</strong>

•   Plug the timer into a regular 230V power outlet and turn the power on. Leave it plugged in for approximately 14 hours to charge the internal battery.

•   Press the <strong>WEEK</strong> button until the correct day of the week is displayed.

•   Press the <strong>HOUR</strong> button until the current hour is displayed (make sure AM/PM is correct).

•   Press the <strong>MINUTE</strong> button until the current minute is displayed.

<strong>2. Program the Timer</strong>

•   Press the <strong>TIMER</strong> button. "OFF_1" will appear on the LCD, showing the first available OFF setting.

•   Press the <strong>HOUR</strong> and <strong>MINUTE</strong> buttons to set the time you want the charger to turn OFF.

•   Press the <strong>WEEK</strong> button to select the days of the week you want this OFF setting to apply to (e.g., every day, weekdays only, weekends only, etc.).

•   Press the <strong>TIMER</strong> button again to finish the first OFF setting and enter the second ON setting. Repeat 2 and 3 to program 2nd OFF setting. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to program up to 8 timer events.
•   Press the <strong>CLOCK</strong> button to return to the regular time display. The timer is now ready to operate.

<strong>3. Important Notes</strong>

•   Make sure your programs don't overlap.
•   The TIMER function only works in AUTO mode.

<strong>Example:</strong>

Let's say you want the timer to turn OFF the charger at 8:00 AM every day:

1.  Set the current time and day.
2.  Press <strong>TIMER</strong>.
3.  Set the HOUR to 8 and the MINUTE to 00.
4.  Press <strong>WEEK</strong> until all days of the week are selected.
5.  Press <strong>CLOCK</strong> to return to the normal time display.
6.  <strong>Press ON/AUTO/OFF button until 'AUTO' shows on the display.</strong>

Now, plug your scooter charger into the timer, and the timer into the wall socket. The charger will automatically turn off at 8:00 AM every day.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Use this information at your own risk. Always ensure your setup is safe and follow all manufacturer instructions for both the timer and your scooter charger. If you have any doubts, consult a qualified electrician.</div>
