  <h1>Description for 4c8ec704756c121cdb843feabbf0ed22.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's craft this wild squad of school subject footballers:

<strong>Formation:</strong> 4-3-3 (Aggressive, possession-based)

<strong>Manager:</strong> Physical Education (PE) - A natural motivator, obsessed with fitness and discipline, but tactically one-dimensional. His halftime talks are just yelling louder.

<strong>The Lineup:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> History - Solid, reliable, knows every trick in the book (from past matches, obviously). A bit slow to react to new situations.
•   <em>IRL Club:<strong> Burnley - Dependable but unexciting.

•   </strong>Right Back:</em><em> Geography - Great spatial awareness, always knows where the opponent is, covers a lot of ground. Prone to aimless wandering.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Atalanta - Energetic and attacking, but sometimes leaves the defense exposed.

•   </strong>Center Back:*<em> Maths - Calculated, precise, tackles perfectly. Can't improvise if something goes wrong.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Atletico Madrid - Organized, defensive, but stifles creativity.

•   </strong>Center Back:*<em> English Literature - Reads the game well, intercepts passes with elegance, but prone to overthinking and making errors.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Arsenal - Beautiful to watch, but always finds a way to mess it up.

•   </strong>Left Back:*<em> Art - Creative flair on the ball, great crosses, but doesn't always track back.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Real Madrid - A bit flashy and inconsistent, but capable of moments of brilliance.

•   </strong>Central Midfield:*<em> Science - Logical, strategic, controls the tempo of the game. Lacks passion.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Manchester City - Clinical and efficient, but soulless.

•   </strong>Central Midfield:*<em> Music - Visionary passer, dictates play with rhythm, but can be easily bullied.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Barcelona - Stylish, technical, but too soft in midfield.

•   </strong>Central Midfield:*<em> Religious Studies - Fair player, tries to understand the opposition, but a bit naive and gets outmuscled easily.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Everton - Good intentions, but ultimately irrelevant.

•   </strong>Right Wing:*<em> Business Studies - Ruthless, always looking for an advantage, dives at every opportunity.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> Juventus - Always finds a way to win, even if it's not pretty.

•   </strong>Striker:*<em> Drama - Loves the spotlight, flamboyant, scores spectacular goals but disappears in big games.
•   </em>IRL Club:<strong> PSG - All the glitz and glamour, but chokes in the Champions League.

•   </strong>Left Wing:*<em> Foreign Language - Adaptable, quick, can confuse the opposition, but sometimes gets lost in translation.
•   </em>IRL Club:** Liverpool - Dynamic and unpredictable, but communication can be an issue.</div>
