  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, looks like the initial "Perfect." video didn't pan out. The YouTube algorithm can be tricky! Since the goal is to find a video about bill wurtz, I need to make a calculated move. I'll look for videos that are related to bill wurtz or his style. I need to get closer to the subject so I don't have to make random clicks.

The "Perfect" video is by bill wurtz, and there is another video called "[Ghibli Piano Collection] - Best Ghibli Collection Love Life More With Ghibli.." this could lead to music related videos! Since this is not good enough, I will try to find anything music-related. I am looking for anything that resembles that genre of content so I get closer to bill wurtz.

After looking around I didn't found any videos that will get me closer to him. So I need to select another starting position to make better choices. And since I was told that failure is death, I must win and that means clicking anything until I achieve my goal! "Time to get Wurtzy!"
