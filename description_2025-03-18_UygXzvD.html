  <h1>Description for 20250317_205309.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the "slap rating" for each of those green characters:

•   <strong>Grassy:</strong> 9/10. He just seems like an annoying little snot.
•   <strong>Tennis Ball:</strong> 2/10. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, he doesn't deserve to be slapped.
•   <strong>Leafy:</strong> 0/10. She's the perfect woman and would not deserve the slightest pain.
•   <strong>Avocado:</strong> 10/10. That smug look is just infuriating. Deserves a double slap.
•   <strong>Gelatin:</strong> 4/10. He's just dumb, nothing to get too angry about.
•   <strong>Two:</strong> 7/10. Seems like a condescending jerk.
•   <strong>8-Ball:</strong> 2/10. He looks like a chill guy.
•   <strong>Leek:</strong> 3/10. Too bland to care enough to slap.
•   <strong>Book:</strong> 5/10. Could be slapped for being too boring.
•   <strong>Match:</strong> 8/10. She's a gossipy mean girl; deserves a good smack.
•   <strong>Phone:</strong> 6/10. That annoying face is just begging for it.
•   <strong>Scissors:</strong> 6/10. Feels like they would try to snip your fingers off.
•   <strong>Balloon:</strong> 7/10. Always seems to have something to complain about.
•   <strong>Lime:</strong> 6/10. The spirals on his face annoy me.
•   <strong>Battery:</strong> 8/10. Hides behind a wall.
•   <strong>Tape:</strong> 5/10. Something tells me they're sticky.

Hope that's the rating you were looking for.</div>
