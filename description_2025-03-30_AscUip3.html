  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, Berishbaev, let's have a look at these clubs, shall we? Atyrau? Honestly, my friend, that's like comparing a rusty bicycle to a Ferrari. Atletico Madrid, okay, a bit of grit, I respect that. But then... Manchester City? You jumped on the bandwagon, didn't you? Chasing the shiny trophies, eh? AC Milan, now there's some history, but they're not what they used to be, are they? And Besiktas... well, at least you have some taste for passion.

It's a bit all over the place, no? Where's the consistency? The dedication? Like a player who can't decide which position to play. Maybe you should pick a side, focus, and then, just maybe, you'll understand what it means to truly support a great club. Until then, enjoy your mixed bag, I guess.</div>
