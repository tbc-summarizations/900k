  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on who fits into each category based on the impact and methods of their actions:

<strong>Noob:</strong>

•   <strong>Derek Chauvin:</strong> A brutal and hate-filled murderer, but overall pretty amateur with a low kill count compared to others on this list. His act also didn't bring change to the world.
•   <strong>Ted Bundy:</strong> Bundy was a vile serial killer, but his methods were somewhat simple and his reach was limited.

<strong>Pro:</strong>

•   <strong>Adolf Hitler:</strong> He was a hate filled murderer, but his reach was insane, leading to a world war. His manipulation skills were godlike.
•   <strong>Jeffrey Epstein:</strong> Master of corruption and exploitation, got away with monstrous crimes for a long time through his network.
•   <strong>Jigsaw:</strong> Highly skilled planner and manipulator, created elaborate death traps. He's sadistic but overall quite genius.
•   <strong>Jefferson Davis:</strong> Leader of the Confederacy, oversaw a massive rebellion that killed hundreds of thousands and divided the United States to try to prolong slavery.
•   <strong>Joseph Stalin:</strong> Ruthless dictator of the Soviet Union, responsible for the deaths of millions.
•   <strong>Mao Zedong:</strong> Led the Chinese Communist Revolution and implemented policies that led to widespread famine and death.
•   <strong>Nathan Bedford Forrest:</strong> Confederate general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Racist and murderous.
•   <strong>Osama Bin Laden:</strong> Leader of al-Qaeda, responsible for the 9/11 attacks.
•   <strong>Pablo Escobar:</strong> Head of the Medellin Cartel, controlled a massive drug empire and used extreme violence to maintain power.
•   <strong>Pol Pot:</strong> Leader of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, responsible for the Cambodian genocide.
•   <strong>Thanos:</strong> Incredibly powerful villain, and overall a tactical genius.
•   <strong>Vlad The Impaler:</strong> Ruthless ruler of Wallachia known for his brutal methods of torture and execution.
•   <strong>Walter White:</strong> Highly intelligent, developed a high-quality drug empire with strategic planning.
•   <strong>William Afton:</strong> Vile serial killer.

<strong>Hacker:</strong>

•   <strong>Darth Vader:</strong> Master of the dark side, could influence other characters with a force.
•   <strong>Death:</strong> Death is omnipresent.
•   <strong>Michael Myers:</strong> Supernatural resilience and stalking abilities, almost unstoppable force.
•   <strong>Pennywise:</strong> Ancient evil entity that uses fear to manipulate and prey on children.
•   <strong>Ronald Reagan:</strong> Reagan used his charm and the power of TV to manipulate the entire public.
•   <strong>Satan:</strong> Master manipulator and tempter, corrupts souls and spreads evil.
•   <strong>Slenderman:</strong> Internet creation with a widespread cultural impact.
•   <strong>The Joker:</strong> Chaos incarnate, extremely unpredictable and manipulative.
•   <strong>Vladimir Putin:</strong> Putin is a master of manipulating the world around him.
•   <strong>Voldemort:</strong> Powerful wizard, with the ability to use dark magic.
•   <strong>Zodiac Killer:</strong> Known for his ciphers.

<strong>Important Considerations:</strong>

•   <strong>"Hacker" Category:</strong> This is a looser category, as I'm applying the concept of "hacking" to those who manipulate systems or exploit vulnerabilities in a grand way, whether it's societal, magical, or spiritual.

Hope that gives you the brutally honest categorization you were looking for.</div>
