  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cook up this elemental football XI. No holding back, eh? Let's get into it.

<strong>Formation:</strong> 4-3-3 (classic, and allows us to showcase the talent)

<strong>Manager:</strong> <strong>Einsteinium (Es)</strong> – Who else to manage this team but a chaotic genius? His grasp of physics and unpredictable nature will lead to either brilliant strategies or complete collapses. No in-between.

<strong>Team Lineup:</strong>

•   <strong>Goalkeeper:</strong> <strong>Argon (Ar)</strong> – Inert and stable, nothing gets past this guy. Calm under pressure, plays for Atlético Madrid.

•   <strong>Right Back:</strong> <strong>Iron (Fe)</strong> – Solid, dependable, and doesn't let anything through. The reliable rock of the defense, plays for Man City.

•   <strong>Center Backs:</strong>
•   <strong>Carbon (C)</strong> – The backbone of any structure, versatile and links up well with others. Plays for Real Madrid.
•   <strong>Phosphorus (P)</strong> – Highly reactive and explosive in challenges. A fiery presence, loves a tackle, plays for PSG.

•   <strong>Left Back:</strong> <strong>Nickel (Ni)</strong> – Tough, durable, and resists corrosion from opposition attacks. Plays for Inter Milan.

•   <strong>Midfielders:</strong>
•   <strong>Tungsten (W)</strong> – High melting point, high work rate. Box-to-box midfielder, never stops running. Plays for Chelsea.
•   <strong>Gold (Au)</strong> – Pure class, distributes the ball with precision and creativity. A luxury player, plays for Barcelona.
•   <strong>Vanadium (V)</strong> – Adds strength and flexibility to the midfield. Adaptable and hardworking, plays for Bayern Munich.

•   <strong>Forwards:</strong>
•   <strong>Hydrogen (H)</strong> – Small, quick, and highly reactive. Can squeeze through any defense, plays for Arsenal.
•   <strong>Uranium (U)</strong> – Powerful, explosive, and can unleash long-range shots that can split atoms. Prone to the occasional meltdown, plays for Juventus.
•   <strong>Oxygen (O)</strong> – Essential for attack, provides the spark and energy. Loves to create chances for others, plays for Liverpool.

<strong>Analysis:</strong>

•   The defense is built on stability and grit. Iron and Nickel offer protection on the flanks, while Carbon and Phosphorus bring strength and passion to the center.
•   The midfield is a blend of artistry and hard work. Tungsten provides the engine, Gold the creativity, and Vanadium the adaptability.
•   Upfront, Hydrogen's pace, Uranium's power, and Oxygen's vision make for a deadly combination.

This team is a mix of brilliance and volatility, much like its manager, Einsteinium. They're capable of dominating any opposition, but a single mistake could lead to a catastrophic collapse. High risk, high reward, that's the Elemental XI.</div>
