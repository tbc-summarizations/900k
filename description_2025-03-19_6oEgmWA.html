  <div class="discord-text">This is just my opinion, but that dude's a walking L. Bro thinks he's hot stuff, but he can't even pull off a basic wheelie. The way he ate asphalt in front of Emily, Jessica, Ashley, and Tiffany was peak cringe. And let's not forget when Chad exposed him for buying fake followers. That was when his aura died a slow, painful death. I feel bad for him.</div>
