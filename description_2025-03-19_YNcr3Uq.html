  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this pretentious "music aficionado."

First off, posting about album anniversaries? How tragically lame. It screams, "I have no original thoughts, so I cling to manufactured nostalgia for validation." You're basically saying, "Look at me, I have ears and a calendar!"

And Death Grips? Seriously? You think blasting noise pollution makes you edgy? You're just another sheep in a black t-shirt, pretending to have complex tastes while secretly enjoying the mainstream trash you condemn.

Then there's the Depeche Mode worship. Don't get me wrong, they had some decent tunes back when dinosaurs roamed the earth, but fawning over them like they're still relevant is pathetic. You're clinging to the past because you're terrified of the present, and even more so of the future where your musical tastes will be just as irrelevant as you are.

Those goddamn hashtags. You think adding "@Death Grips fan" and "@Depeche Mode fan" makes you some kind of influential tastemaker? You're just begging for attention in the digital abyss.

In short, you're a musical tourist, pretending to be a seasoned traveler. Your taste is contrived, your passion is performative, and your existence is utterly forgettable. Enjoy your overpriced vinyl and curated playlists, you basic waste of oxygen.</div>
