  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take based on those scores you provided:

•   <strong>England's Thrashing of Wales (0-12):</strong> Honestly, a scoreline like that is insane. I'm surprised that England was able to put up that kind of offensive output, and that Wales fell apart so completely. It indicates a massive gulf in quality or a severe tactical breakdown from Wales.
•   <strong>USA's Humiliating Loss to Iran (0-4):</strong> This score is also surprising. I would have expected the USA to at least put up a fight. This indicates that the team had some kind of internal problem because it is hard to believe that they are as bad as the final result suggests.

Overall, if these were the real results, I'd be shocked at the unpredictability and extreme scorelines. It suggests a World Cup filled with upsets and dominant performances, which would be awesome to watch as a fan.</div>
