  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's a detailed description of the media file:

The video shows a person unlocking their iPhone and then using it with a wireless charger attached to a string hanging from the ceiling. They swipe up to unlock the phone with Face ID or a passcode. The phone screen displays a colorful, abstract background. After unlocking, the person navigates the phone briefly before turning it over to reveal a black case with a pop socket. The individual then lifts the phone up to the wireless charger, which is suspended in the air. As the phone connects to the charger, a charging animation with a green lightning bolt appears on the screen. The camera then zooms out to show the phone hanging in the air, charging, with a notebook, laptop, and other items visible on a desk below. Finally, the person moves the phone around, demonstrating its floating charging capability.</div>
