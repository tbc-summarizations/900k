  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's a brutally honest prediction of those World Cup groups:

<strong>Group A:</strong>

•   <strong>Italy:</strong> Let's face it, they aren't making it out of this group, this team is a shadow of its former self, and they won't be posing a threat to anyone.
•   <strong>Czechia:</strong> They are not making it out of the group stage either.
•   <strong>Serbia:</strong> They are also not making it out of the group stage, as they are a joke of a team.
•   <strong>Qatar:</strong> Qatar will be the worst team in the group. They will be humiliated on home soil.

<strong>Group B:</strong>

•   <strong>Argentina:</strong> Argentina will have no problem advancing out of the group stage.
•   <strong>Denmark:</strong> Denmark might pose some threat, but not much.
•   <strong>Poland:</strong> Poland will likely be the third team to be eliminated from the group stage.
•   <strong>Norway:</strong> The Norwegian team is an average team.

<strong>Group C:</strong>

•   <strong>France:</strong> France will easily top this group. They're far ahead of the rest.
•   <strong>Senegal:</strong> This will depend on how they perform.
•   <strong>Peru:</strong> They will finish last in the group.
•   <strong>Slovenia:</strong> They will pose some threat in the group stage.

<strong>Group D:</strong>

•   <strong>Spain:</strong> Spain is the clear favorite.
•   <strong>United States:</strong> USA is overrated, they won't pose a threat to Spain, but they should get out of the group.
•   <strong>Australia:</strong> Australia has no chance. They'll be lucky to get a point.
•   <strong>Ecuador:</strong> They're also weak. They lack the quality to compete.

<strong>Group E:</strong>

•   <strong>England:</strong> This is England's group to lose. They should win it comfortably.
•   <strong>Sweden:</strong> They won't be a threat.
•   <strong>Costa Rica:</strong> Costa Rica is getting worse and worse. They will be eliminated.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> Turkey is weak.

<strong>Group F:</strong>

•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> They have no chances of advancing to the next round.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Portugal should win this group pretty easily.
•   <strong>Croatia:</strong> Croatia can advance to the next round as well.
•   <strong>Russia:</strong> They will be eliminated.

<strong>Group G:</strong>

•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> Belgium should win this group.
•   <strong>Uruguay:</strong> They won't be posing any threat, they will be eliminated.
•   <strong>South Korea:</strong> They won't be posing any threat, they will be eliminated.
•   <strong>Ghana:</strong> This team is going to be a laughingstock.

<strong>Group H:</strong>

•   <strong>Brazil:</strong> Clear favorites to win the group.
•   <strong>Colombia:</strong> They aren't at their best, but they could still qualify.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> Ukraine won't pose any threat.
•   <strong>Montenegro:</strong> Montenegro will be dead last. A horrible team.</div>
