  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into this digital dumpster fire:

•   *<em>"\</em>Choco-Niki Jk, I am not ur a man? Ye"<strong>: This is a certified "I have the humor of a door hinge" moment. The comedy is so dry, the Sahara desert is jealous.

•   </strong>"Lmfao..."<strong>: The epitome of "I have nothing of value to add but want to seem like I'm in on the joke." Go back to scrolling, you human buffering icon.

•   </strong>"are you fucking gay"<strong>: AdamMady is so insecure about his own sexuality that he resorts to asking this.

•   </strong>"what race are you"<strong>: Drake's casual racism is just the cherry on top of this trash sundae. Like, did your brain get lost on the way here or were you born a couple of fries short of a Happy Meal?

•   </strong>"@Meethexep gay"<strong>: HappyMan and Berishbaev are the type of people that jump into a conversation just to say something that contributes nothing.

•   </strong>"Wha"*<em>: \</em>Choco-Niki finally realizes the stupidity of the conversation.

•   <strong>"yo guus that was a prankvbro"</strong>: Meethexep thinks trying to hook up with minors is a "prank." His excuse is as believable as a politician's promise.

•   <strong>"@Meethexep wanted to have kids with you bro"</strong>: AdamMady is so quick to jump to Meethexep wanting kids with him. Are you guys trying to start a polyamorous relationship or something?

•   <strong>"MEETHEXEP STOP HES ONLY 12"</strong>: This is the only sane person in this group. It's sad that the bar is this low. Someone call the internet police, because this entire group needs to be arrested for cringe and potential felony.

Overall, this entire exchange sounds like it was written by a group of lobotomized parrots after binge-watching a season of "Jersey Shore". Congrats on achieving peak degeneracy.</div>
