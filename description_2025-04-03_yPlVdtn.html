  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this theoretical "Most G/A XI" for the 2024/25 season, no holds barred:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (out of 10):</strong>

•   <strong>Ederson (3x G/A):</strong> 3/10. Great shot-stopper and distributor, but 3 G/A? That screams terrible defensive errors leading to goals. A liability in this XI.
•   <strong>Grimaldo (15x G/A):</strong> 6/10. Okay going forward, but is he defensively solid enough for a top team? Doubtful. Likely to be exposed against high-quality wingers.
•   <strong>Gabriel (8x G/A):</strong> 4/10. Prone to rash decisions and individual errors. This team would be conceding soft goals with him at the back.
•   <strong>I. Martinez (8x G/A):</strong> 5/10. Aging and not the player he once was. He is definitely going to get cooked by any pacey winger.
•   <strong>Hakimi (17x G/A):</strong> 7/10. Excellent going forward, but his defensive discipline can be questionable at times. A gamble.
•   <strong>Bellingham (24x G/A):</strong> 8/10. A box-to-box beast with a great engine and scoring ability. One of the few bright spots in this midfield.
•   <strong>Wirtz (28x G/A):</strong> 7/10. Creative and skillful, but can he handle the physical demands of a truly top-tier team? A bit of a question mark.
•   <strong>B. Fernandes (32x G/A):</strong> 6/10. Overrated. Gets plenty of assists, but also gives the ball away far too often. A frustrating player to have.
•   <strong>Raphinha (47x G/A):</strong> 7/10. Can be inconsistent. Good dribbler and finisher, but needs to be more clinical to be a truly elite winger.
•   <strong>Kane (45x G/A):</strong> 9/10. A goal-scoring machine and a great passer. The only reason this team has any hope of scoring goals.
•   <strong>Salah (54x G/A):</strong> 9/10. Deadly finisher and a constant threat to defenders. Carries the attacking weight with Kane.

<strong>Team Rating (out of 10):</strong>

<strong>5/10</strong>. This team would be a mess. The attack might be able to score some goals, but the defense is an absolute disaster waiting to happen. The midfield is inconsistent, and the goalkeeper is a liability. This team would get destroyed by any well-organized opponent. Overhyped individuals do not make a great team, and this XI is a prime example of that.</div>
