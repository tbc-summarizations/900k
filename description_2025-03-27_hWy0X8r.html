  <h1>Description for IMG_5604.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The players are likely surprised and reacting with "EW," "BRO," "WTH," and "DUDE??" because of the absurd and unexpected combination of elements in the scene. 

First of all, there is a ring camera pointing at the scene, next to wall art of sonic the hedgehog with drip, and then to anime characters.

Then there is also a hat that looks like something is growing on it.

The overall randomness and meme-like quality of the setup are probably what elicited those reactions.</div>
