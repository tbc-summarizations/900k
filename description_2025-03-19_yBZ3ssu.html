  <div class="discord-text">Okay, let's tear into this digital garbage.

First off, "Playboi Carti" needs to learn basic grammar. "YE STFU"? Is that supposed to be an insult? More like a toddler tantrum. And that profile pic? He looks like a rejected Men in Black recruit.

Then we have "Spectre" jumping in with "GET HIS ASS CARTI." Seriously? You're a ghost emoji telling a mumble rapper to fight someone. Maybe haunt a library and learn some vocabulary.

Overall, this is just pathetic. Two desperate attempts at online clout, failing miserably. Get a grip, losers.</div>
