  <h1>Description for Screenshot_20250329_030553_Discord.jpg</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of those messages:

1.  <strong>AdamMady:</strong> "@Meethexep wanted to have kids with you bro" - This is the worst of the bunch. It's predatory, inappropriate, and clearly targets someone who is a minor. The "bro" doesn't make it any better, it makes it worse.

2.  <strong>Berishbaev:</strong> "MEETHEXEP STOP HES ONLY 12" - This shows alarm and attempts to stop the interaction, acknowledging the age.

3.  <strong>Berishbaev</strong> "@Meethexep gay" - This message is just immature and offensive.

4.  <strong>HappyMan</strong> "@Meethexep gay" - Same as above, just immature and offensive.

5.  <strong>AdamMady:</strong> "are you fucking gay" - This is homophobic and aggressive. It contributes to a hostile environment.

6. <strong>Meethexep:</strong> "yo guus that was a prankvbro" - This is a weak attempt to backtrack. The damage is done.

7.  <strong>AdamMady:</strong> "ur a man?" - The intent is to know the gender of someone whom one is trying to have children with.

8.  <strong>Drake:</strong> "what race are you" - While asking someone's race is not illegal, it could be due to racial biases.
9.  <strong>Choco-Niki:</strong> "Wha" - This is a simple expression of confusion or disbelief.

10. <strong>Berishbaev</strong> "Lmfao..." - Dismissive and insensitive, but less explicitly harmful than the others.
11. <strong>Choco-Niki:</strong> "Ye" - Simple response. Harmless.

12.  <strong>Choco-Niki:</strong> "Jk, I am not" - Just a statement. Harmless.</div>
