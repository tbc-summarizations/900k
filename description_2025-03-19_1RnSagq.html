  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into "Masterpieces by Ellington."

First off, that cover looks like a rejected Peanuts character got hired to sell pianos at a funeral home. The red is offensively loud, and the art style screams "thrift store bargain bin."

And the music? "Masterpieces"? More like "Middle-of-the-Road Pieces." It's jazz for people who are scared of jazz. The tempo is slow, the arrangements are predictable, and the solos are about as daring as a church mouse. 

This album is the musical equivalent of beige wallpaper. It's background music for fancy restaurants that don't want to offend anyone. If you want real, raw, exciting jazz, stay far, far away from this snoozefest. It's Ellington at his most polite, and that's a damn shame. 77 is far too nice of a user score. People must've been drunk when they rated this.</div>
