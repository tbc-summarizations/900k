<strong>(Intro - Beat drops, heavy bass with a Central Asian vibe)</strong>

<strong>ANNOUNCER:</strong> EPIC RAP BATTLES OF... I'm serious... Central Asia?
HENRYTHEKAZAKH... VERSUS... ELLIETHEKYRGYZ!
BEGIN!

<strong>HENRYTHEKAZAKH:</strong>
Yo, it's Henry, the Kazakh king, watch me rise,
Spitting fire hotter than the desert in your eyes.
Atletico Madrid, that's passion, that's the fight,
You cheer for Real? Guess you're used to being second rate all the time.
Violator? Classic, dark, a masterpiece,
Your Tom Sawyer's Momma? Sounds like you're missing family, not your favorite album.
Adam, Meeth, HappyMan, yeah, my crew's the best,
While youâ€™re stuck with Eve, Antidoote, SadWoman? Is that the end of your alphabet? It looks like a cry for help.

<strong>ELLIETHEKYRGYZ:</strong>
(Scoffs) Silence is golden, something you wouldn't know,
With that loud mouth of yours, a constant, grating flow.
Basketball over football? At least it's a sport that takes real skill,
Unlike your club, whose success is purely a joke.
Real Madrid reigns, the best in the field,
You're stuck in the second tier, a loser for real.
Momma is complex, you would not get it.
Your friends are nothing! you and your friend group just look like a joke.

<strong>HENRYTHEKAZAKH:</strong>
Skill? You and your silence are clearly deaf.
If real Madrid has any money it should go to your dentist!
Your silence isn't golden, it's just boring and bland,
I prefer my music loud, a pulse across the land.
You said Momma is complex. I don't think you would know how to make that claim,
Your friends would never save you in an emergency, and I could win with my friends.

<strong>ELLIETHEKYRGYZ:</strong>
Bland? I am more creative then you and your crew combined!
You are as bland as a tortilla from the USA!
You could never be me and that just gives me the giggles!
I am more beautiful than you ever will be. 

<strong>(Beat fades out)</strong>

<strong>ANNOUNCER:</strong>
WHO WON?
WHO'S NEXT?
YOU DECIDE!
EPIC RAP BATTLES OF CANCER!!!</div>
