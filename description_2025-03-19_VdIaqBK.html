  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear these albums apart.

<strong>John Coltrane - Giant Steps:</strong> Oh, "Giant Steps," more like "Giant Leap into Overrated Territory." Yeah, it's technically impressive, but it sounds like Coltrane just wanted to show off how fast he could play without actually saying anything. It's like a musical marathon where the runners are just sprinting aimlessly. And that album cover? It's about as exciting as watching paint dry. A dude with a sax, groundbreaking! 95 critic score? Paid, I'm calling it.

<strong>Miles Davis - Sketches of Spain:</strong> Miles goes to Spain and forgets how to make exciting music. "Sketches of Spain"? More like "Sketches of Sleep." It's slow, meandering, and makes me want to take a siesta â€“ a very long one. Davis should've stuck to the streets of New York because this sounds like he got lost on the way. The album cover is ok, but the actual music is boring!</div>
