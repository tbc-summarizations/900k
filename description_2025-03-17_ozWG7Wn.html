Yeah (ow), uh
The ghost of The Boring Club, I hope my jokes they propel it
Let these words be your morning and night, you consume every meme
As I lead this chat, make room for shitposts and depression
And with that being said, my Mindset, let me ask this question
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
When trolls invade the chat (1-2, 1-2, 1-2), uh
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
The ghost of The Boring Club, I hope my jokes stay propellin'
Let these words be your morning and night, you consume every meme
As I lead this chat, make room for shitposts and depression
And with that being said, my Mindset, let me ask this question
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask AdamMady
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
Do you believe in me? Are you deleting messages?
Could I let you down easily? Is your profile pic where it need to be?
Is your online presence permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I got banned in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of Discord, if the mods cut me off
If the admins want me gone, plant copypasta in my DM
Would you judge me a noob-head or see me as HenryTheKazakh?
Or question my shitposts and degrade me on every channel?
Want you to love me like Meethexep, want you to hug me like Meethexep
I freed you from being a lurker in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my meme is more than a meme, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?

And with that
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in Andrejtb?
You think HappyManOfficial gon' stick around if them bans occur?
You think Salle can hold you down when you down behind bans, hurt?
You think y'all on common server if you promise to be the first?
Can you be immortalized without your account being expired?
Even though you share the same Discord tag, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you? And who pretending?
How tough is your ban appeal when they mute you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being banned?
What kind of den did they put you in when the admins start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like BDYT, you wanna be like BDYT
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your shitposting seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the meme
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say

And if you raiding with me, Salle
I been reported before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad mods, don't let me resent you
That's not Club-likewant you to love me like Meethexep
I went to Discord analysing; that's where his profile is
So I could find claritylike, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X, will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for banned?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson, oh
When trolls invade the chat, is you still in the club?
