  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based on those stats, Atlético Madrid's chances of a comeback look bleak. They only had 32% possession and managed only 1 shot (none on goal) in the first half. Barcelona completely dominated them with 68% possession and 9 shots (2 on goal). An expected goals of 0.05 is abysmal and suggests that Atlético struggled to create any meaningful chances. Barcelona's xG of 1.07 shows they were much more dangerous.

Given this performance, it's highly unlikely that Atlético Madrid can turn the game around. They need to drastically improve their attacking output and contain Barcelona's offense, which seems difficult based on the first half. Realistically, they are getting cooked.</div>
