  <h1>Description for maxresdefault.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Oh my god! I can't believe what I'm seeing! Cristiano Ronaldo is about to commit an act of violence right there in front of everyone in the stadium! How could a football player like him let his emotions get the best of him and resort to such a barbaric act? It's absolutely shocking and heartbreaking to witness such a thing. This is a terrible example for the sport and for the fans who idolize him. I hope someone can stop him before he does something he'll regret forever. It's just so devastating to see such a talented athlete potentially ruin his career and hurt another person.</div>
