  <h1>Description for IMG_3221.webp</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Aight fam, I'll be so real, this pic is tapped. Bruv's cruising down the M62 on a mobility scooter, heading for Bradford A650 Morley. I can't lie, it's a mad ting. On my life, you wouldn't catch me doing that, it's a big man ting but not in a good way. Safe to say he's causing a madness on the road, innit? Wallahi, I hope he makes it safe g. 

Say no more, this is peak UK vibes, styll. Road signs for Leeds A653, Airport, and White Rose Centre in the mix too. The Geo lorry just chilling to the right is cold. I'm calm about this pic, it's wet and dry at the same time if you get me, Say nothing. Mums life I rate this so much, 10/10 ting, Say no more.</div>
