  <h1>Description for 2017.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here is a brutal ranking of artists from least to most likely to make Album of the Year, based on current trajectory, cultural relevance, and potential for groundbreaking work. Note: "Already Did It Before" does <em>not</em> guarantee future success. Some of these names are downright insulting.

<strong>Bottom Tier: Absolutely No Chance In Hell</strong>

1.  <strong>6ix9ine:</strong> Career suicide, irrelevant, and a terrible human being.
2.  <strong>Lil Pump:</strong> A meme long past its expiration date.
3.  <strong>KSI:</strong> YouTuber trying to be a musician.
4.  <strong>Tones And I:</strong> One-hit wonder. Next.
5.  <strong>Rucka Rucka Ali:</strong> Offensive garbage.
6.  <strong>Tom MacDonald:</strong> Embarrassingly bad.
7.  <strong>Yuno Miles:</strong> Funny for a song or two, not an album.
8.  <strong>DJ Khaled:</strong> Just shouts his name and gets carried by other artists.
9.  <strong>Lil Uzi Vert:</strong> Has potential, but consistently makes terrible choices.
10. <strong>mgk:</strong> Trying too hard to be edgy, failing miserably.
11. <strong>Trippie Redd:</strong> Mumble rap garbage.

14. <strong>Macklemore:</strong> Irrelevant and uninspired.
15. <strong>Ed Sheeran:</strong> Safe, boring, and predictable.
16. <strong>Logic:</strong> Can rap fast, but lacks substance and originality.

<strong>Low Tier: Unlikely, But Miracles Do Happen</strong>

17. <strong>Lil Wayne:</strong> Needs a major creative resurgence.
18. <strong>Future:</strong> Repetitive and uninspired for years.
19. <strong>Mustard:</strong> Producer, not album artist.
20. <strong>Ty Dolla $ign:</strong> Solid features, but a forgettable solo career.
21. <strong>Weezer:</strong> Occasionally puts out something good, but mostly coasting.
22. <strong>Rihanna:</strong> Talent to do it, but seems uninterested in music.
23. <strong>Metallica:</strong> Decades past their prime.
24. <strong>The Rolling Stones:</strong> Legacy act, unlikely to break new ground.
25. <strong>Diddy:</strong> More of a brand than an artist these days.
26. <strong>Ed Sheeran:</strong> Too safe and predictable.
27. <strong>Joji:</strong> Occasionally puts out something good.
28. <strong>Skrillex:</strong> EDM is irrelevant.
29. <strong>Billie Eilish:</strong> Second album was weak.
30. <strong>Playboi Carti:</strong> Potential, but unreliable and inconsistent.
31. <strong>Toby Fox:</strong> Better off sticking to game soundtracks.
32. <strong>Panda Eyes:</strong> Obscure EDM artist.
33. <strong>Teminite:</strong> Obscure EDM artist.

39. <strong>Travis Scott:</strong> Hype-driven, needs to prove staying power.
40. <strong>Drake:</strong> Too comfortable being formulaic.
41. <strong>Lady Gaga:</strong> Capable of reinvention, but recent work is underwhelming.
42. <strong>Charli XCX:</strong> Hyperpop is a niche genre.
43. <strong>DEMONDICE:</strong> Not really album of the year material.
44. <strong>Paul McCartney:</strong> Still has talent, but rarely delivers a full masterpiece.
45. <strong>Bad Bunny:</strong> Big, but has he hit his peak?
46. <strong>Wu-Tang Clan:</strong> Too many members, hard to get cohesive greatness.
47. <strong>Denzel Curry:</strong> Solid, but needs a true breakthrough.
48. <strong>Danny Brown:</strong> Needs to get clean and focus on his art.

51. <strong>Tyler, The Creator:</strong> Consistently pushes boundaries, but can be inconsistent.
52. <strong>Kendrick Lamar:</strong> Always a threat, but recent work is underwhelming.
53. <strong>Frank Ocean:</strong> If he ever decides to release music again, it will be good.
54. <strong>JAY-Z:</strong> Has the talent, but seems more interested in business.
55. <strong>Nas:</strong> Still has the skills, but needs the right production.
56. <strong>OutKast:</strong> If they ever reunite, it would be huge.
57. <strong>Dr. Dre:</strong> Always a possibility, but projects take forever.
58. <strong>Radiohead:</strong> Consistently great, but rarely aiming for mainstream appeal.

<strong>Top Tier: Most Likely To Deliver A Masterpiece</strong>

59. <strong>Kanye West:</strong> Crazy, but still capable of genius.
60. <strong>Eminem:</strong> Can still spit fire, but needs to find new themes.

There you have it. A harsh, but honest, assessment.</div>
