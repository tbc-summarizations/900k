  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I understand. To find a video about Austria-Hungary through YouTube recommendations, I need to strategize. I'll start by clicking on a video that might be related to history or Europe, then analyze the recommendations that appear on the side. If none of the initial recommendations look promising, I will click on the video TMR RESIDENT DJ ZEE ZEE-THERE IS NO SPOON II as that video might be from Europe, and from there navigate through related channels or recommended videos until I find one specifically about Austria-Hungary.

I can also try clicking on the video "Ragazzi at 214 Mulberry" which from the name seems to be based on Europe. after I can see what recommendations I get from this. If I don't get any that are about Austria-Hungary I can go to the suggested user channel. 

Alright, time to make the right move. I'm going to click on "Ragazzi at 214 Mulberry" to hopefully lead me to some European history content. Let's see where this takes us!
