  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on those 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage matches:

•   <strong>Germany 1-2 Japan:</strong> Utter embarrassment for Germany. They played like arrogant fools who thought they could just stroll through the group. Japan exposed their lack of creativity and defensive frailty. A deserved loss.
•   <strong>Spain 7-0 Costa Rica:</strong> A total demolition. Spain showed their class and ruthlessness. Costa Rica looked like they didn't even belong on the same field.
•   <strong>Japan 0-1 Costa Rica:</strong> Japan's arrogance bit them in the ass. After beating Germany, they probably thought they had an easy game against Costa Rica, but they got a reality check. They were unable to break down the Costa Rican defense and lacked creativity in attack.
•   <strong>Spain 1-1 Germany:</strong> A decent match, but nothing special. Both teams showed their strengths and weaknesses. Spain's tiki-taka was mesmerizing at times, but Germany's resilience and experience kept them in the game.
•   <strong>Japan 2-1 Spain:</strong> Another shocker. Japan proved that their win against Germany wasn't a fluke. Spain underestimated them and paid the price. Japan's tactical discipline and counter-attacking prowess were on full display.
•   <strong>Costa Rica 2-4 Germany:</strong> Germany's pathetic attempt to salvage their reputation. They managed to beat a weak Costa Rica team, but it was too little, too late. Their overall performance was still a disgrace.

Overall, these matches were full of surprises and upsets. They showed that anything can happen in football and that no team should be underestimated. Germany's performance was especially disappointing, while Japan's was a pleasant surprise. Spain's inconsistency was also frustrating.</div>
