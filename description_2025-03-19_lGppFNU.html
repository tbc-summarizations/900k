  <div class="discord-text">In this conversation, AdamMady is absolutely right, and TSpakler is trying to be manipulative and greedy. Let me break it down:

<strong>TSpakler's Strategy:</strong>
•   <strong>The "Split or Steal" Game:</strong> TSpakler is referencing a classic game theory scenario.
•   <strong>The "Guaranteed" Split Lie:</strong> TSpakler is suggesting that the best strategy is to say you're going to steal, promise to pay them if they split, and then expect them to always split. This is a straight-up lie!
•   <strong>Why It's Wrong:</strong> There is no guarantee that the other person will split. In fact, TSpakler's "summary" stating "The Opponent Will 100% Choose SPLIT" is completely false. A rational player would realize that TSpakler is likely bluffing and choose to steal, hoping to double-cross them.

<strong>Why AdamMady is Right:</strong>
•   <strong>Recognizing Greed:</strong> AdamMady immediately sees through TSpakler's BS and calls it out for being greedy.

<strong>In Conclusion:</strong>
TSpakler is trying to manipulate AdamMady by suggesting a "strategy" that is based on deception and a false promise of guaranteed cooperation. They deserve to be mocked for such a dumbass proposal. AdamMady is right to call them out.</div>
