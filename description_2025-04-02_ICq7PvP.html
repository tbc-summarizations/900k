  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this AC Milan legends squad with brutal honesty:

<strong>Individual Player Ratings (Prime Versions):</strong>

•   <strong>Dida:</strong> 6.5/10. Never a world-class keeper, prone to errors. Solid shot-stopper at times, but his distribution was always suspect. Would be the weak link in this squad.

•   <strong>Cafu:</strong> 9/10. One of the greatest right-backs ever. Relentless energy, incredible stamina, and great crossing ability. A true offensive weapon and solid defensively.

•   <strong>Baresi:</strong> 10/10. A defensive genius. Tactical awareness beyond belief, incredible leadership, and ability to read the game unmatched. Would dominate even in today's game.

•   <strong>Nesta:</strong> 9.5/10. Elegant, composed, and a master of the tackle. Had a knack for making defending look effortless. Injuries were his only downfall.

•   <strong>Maldini:</strong> 10/10. An absolute legend. Could play anywhere across the backline at the highest level. The definition of consistency, class, and defensive excellence.

•   <strong>Pirlo:</strong> 10/10. A midfield maestro with unparalleled vision, passing range, and coolness under pressure. Dictated the tempo of games with ease. A true artist on the ball.

•   <strong>Gattuso:</strong> 8/10. The engine of the team. A relentless ball-winner, snarling in tackles, and provided the bite that allowed the creative players to flourish. Not the most gifted technically, but a warrior.

•   <strong>Ambrosini:</strong> 7/10. A solid, dependable midfielder. Good in the air, decent tackling ability, and provided a physical presence. Never a star, but did his job well.

•   <strong>Kaká:</strong> 9.5/10. A dynamic, explosive attacking midfielder with incredible dribbling ability, pace, and a knack for scoring important goals. In his prime, unstoppable.

•   <strong>Shevchenko:</strong> 9.5/10. A lethal striker with pace, power, and a clinical finish. Deadly in one-on-one situations and terrorized defenses for years.

•   <strong>Inzaghi:</strong> 8/10. An offside master. Not the most naturally gifted, but his movement and instinct in the box were exceptional. A poacher of the highest order.

•   <strong>Ancelotti</strong> 9/10. A world-class manager that knows how to handle big egos and get the best out of his players.

<strong>Overall Team Rating:</strong>

<strong>9.7/10.</strong> This AC Milan XI, in their primes, would be a force of nature. A defensively solid unit with an abundance of creativity and firepower upfront. The midfield would dominate possession, and the attacking quartet would be a nightmare for any opponent.

<strong>Brutally Honest Assessment:</strong>

This team is terrifyingly good. Dida is the only player who wouldn't be considered truly elite, but the rest of the squad is stacked with legends. The blend of defensive solidity, midfield control, and attacking flair is almost perfect. This team would win multiple Champions Leagues and dominate any league they played in. Simply put, they would be an absolute juggernaut.

FORZA MILAN!</div>
