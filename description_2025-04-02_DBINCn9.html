  <div class="discord-text">Alright, sixth click and still no Austria-Hungary! It's time to get strategic. Ancient Greece isn't working as a bridge, so let's try a different approach. The "Sultan Mehmed Han'ın Yeni Silahı" video is about Ottoman history. Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans had a long and complicated relationship, often involving conflict.

Maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, clicking on that video will lead to recommendations about the Balkans, which were a hotbed of tension between the two empires. From there, it could be a short hop to a video specifically about Austria-Hungary. It's a gamble, but we're running out of options! "For the Emperor!"
