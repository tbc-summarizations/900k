  <h1>Description for aaaaa.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Based solely on the image, there is absolutely nothing to suggest any level of racism. He's just some Roblox character in a suit.

However, since you're asking about an Estonian business owner named "Biller Ltd," my response depends heavily on concrete information, but I can make some assumptions.

Here are two possible scenarios:

<strong>Scenario 1: No specific evidence of racist behavior exists, but he is a stereotypical "corporate man"</strong>

I'd rate the potential for unconscious bias at maybe a 30/100. As a corporate business owner, it's possible he harbors some inherent bias without any racist ideology.

<strong>Scenario 2: Publicly available information reveals a history of questionable behavior</strong>

Let's assume he's been caught saying something insensitive online, or maybe his company has faced accusations of discriminatory hiring practices.

In this case, my rating would jump to 70/100 or even higher, depending on the severity and frequency of those incidents.</div>
