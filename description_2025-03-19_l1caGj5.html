  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these John Coltrane albums.

<strong>"My Favorite Things"</strong>: Okay, so you took a song from "The Sound of Music" and made it jazz. Groundbreaking. It's like Coltrane heard Julie Andrews and thought, "I can make this <em>way</em> more complicated." It's a bit like putting a silk hat on a pig. And yes, it's famous, but sometimes fame is just a popularity contest won by mediocrity. The user score is inflated by people who want to sound cultured.

<strong>"Africa/Brass"</strong>: "Africa/Brass" is basically Coltrane's attempt to prove he could conduct a small orchestra. It sounds like he tried to cram every African musical idea he ever had into one record. It's ambitious, but also kind of a mess. The critic score is lower than "My Favorite Things," which makes perfect sense. At least "My Favorite Things" knows what it is, even if what it is is a weird remix.</div>
