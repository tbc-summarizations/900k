  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because here's my brutally honest take on the ranking of evil, from least to most:

1.  <strong>Ronald Reagan:</strong> His policies had negative consequences for some, but not on the scale of intentional, targeted atrocities. He's more controversial than outright evil.
2.  <strong>Walter White:</strong> He started out trying to provide for his family, but the power corrupted him. His actions hurt those around him, but his scale of evil is relatively small compared to others on this list.
3.  <strong>Jefferson Davis:</strong> As President of the Confederacy, he defended a system built on slavery. Morally reprehensible, but not on par with mass murderers.
4.  <strong>Darth Vader:</strong> A fictional character, but within the Star Wars universe, he committed heinous acts as a Sith Lord, though he ultimately redeemed himself.
5.  <strong>Nathan Bedford Forrest:</strong> A Confederate general and the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. His actions and leadership directly contributed to racial terror and violence.
6.  <strong>Vlad The Impaler:</strong> Known for impaling his enemies, a brutal method of warfare, but arguably within the context of his time and less about ideological destruction.
7.  <strong>Pablo Escobar:</strong> A drug kingpin responsible for countless deaths and widespread corruption, but his motivations were primarily financial gain.
8.  <strong>Derek Chauvin:</strong> Abused his power as a police officer and murdered George Floyd. His actions sparked outrage and highlighted systemic issues.
9.  <strong>Jeffrey Epstein:</strong> A sex offender who abused and exploited underage girls. His crimes were depraved and caused immense harm to his victims.
10. <strong>Ted Bundy:</strong> A serial killer who preyed on young women. His actions were calculated and cruel.
11. <strong>The Zodiac Killer:</strong> An unidentified serial killer who terrorized communities with his unsolved crimes and taunting letters.
12. <strong>Jigsaw:</strong> A fictional character who subjects his victims to deadly "games" as a twisted form of justice.
13. <strong>Osama Bin Laden:</strong> The mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, responsible for the deaths of thousands. His actions were driven by extremist ideology.
14. <strong>Vladimir Putin:</strong> The current leader of Russia, responsible for numerous human rights abuses, political assassinations, and military aggressions, including the ongoing war in Ukraine.
15. <strong>Michael Myers:</strong> A fictional serial killer who embodies pure evil.
16. <strong>Pennywise:</strong> A fictional demonic entity that preys on the fears of children, causing terror and death.
17. <strong>Adolf Hitler:</strong> The leader of Nazi Germany, responsible for the Holocaust and the deaths of millions. His ideology of racial supremacy led to unimaginable atrocities.
18. <strong>Pol Pot:</strong> The leader of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, responsible for the deaths of millions through starvation, forced labor, and executions.
19. <strong>Joseph Stalin:</strong> The dictator of the Soviet Union, responsible for the deaths of millions through purges, forced collectivization, and political repression.
20. <strong>Mao Zedong:</strong> The leader of the Chinese Communist Party, responsible for the deaths of millions through famine, forced labor, and political purges.
21. <strong>William Afton:</strong> A fictional serial killer who murders children and haunts animatronic robots, causing endless suffering.
22. <strong>Slenderman:</strong> A fictional internet meme that has inspired real-life violence and terror.
23. <strong>Voldemort:</strong> A fictional dark wizard who seeks to control the wizarding world through fear and violence.
24. <strong>Thanos:</strong> A fictional villain who seeks to eliminate half of all life in the universe to restore balance.
25. <strong>Satan:</strong> The personification of evil, responsible for tempting humanity and leading them astray.
26. <strong>Death:</strong> The inevitable end of all life, the ultimate force of destruction and loss.</div>
