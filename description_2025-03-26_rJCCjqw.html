  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down this squad with some real talk.

<strong>Overall Lineup Rating: 6.5/10</strong>

It's got some serious star power up front, but the midfield and defense are shaky. It feels like a team built for highlights rather than grinding out wins.

<strong>Individual Player Ratings &amp; Brutal Assessments:</strong>

â€¢   <strong>Goalkeeper: Wojciech Szczesny (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±) - 7.5/10</strong>
â€¢   Solid shot-stopper, no doubt. Can pull off the spectacular save. But, his distribution is suspect, and he's prone to a costly blunder now and then. A good, but not great, keeper.
â€¢   <strong>Defender: Theo Hernandez (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) - 7/10</strong>
â€¢   Explosive pace and loves to get forward. Great for attacking but can leave his defence exposed.
â€¢   <strong>Defender: Thiago Silva (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) - 6/10</strong>
â€¢   Experience is valuable, but he's past his prime. His reading of the game is still top-notch, but his lack of pace is a major liability. Any fast attacker will give him nightmares.
â€¢   <strong>Defender: Maya Yoshida (ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ) - 5/10</strong>
â€¢   Hardworking, but simply not good enough for a "Team of the Season". Lacks the pace, strength, and technical ability to compete with top attackers. A weak link.
â€¢   <strong>Defender: Diogo Dalot (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹) - 6.5/10</strong>
â€¢   Decent going forward, but defensively inconsistent. Can be caught out of position and lacks the physicality to dominate his opponents.
â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Neymar (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) - 7/10</strong>
â€¢   A shadow of his former self. Still has moments of brilliance, but his work rate is questionable. He's more interested in showboating than tracking back and defending.
â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Bruno Fernandes (ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹) - 7.5/10</strong>
â€¢   A creative force with an eye for goal. His passing range is excellent, but he can be wasteful in possession. His defensive contribution is minimal.
â€¢   <strong>Midfielder: Rodri (ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸) - 8/10</strong>
â€¢   The only truly reliable midfielder in this lineup. A defensive rock who breaks up plays and keeps things ticking over. Lacks the flair of the other midfielders, but his importance cannot be understated.
â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Kylian Mbappe (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) - 9/10</strong>
â€¢   Lightning-fast, clinical finisher, and a nightmare for defenders. Unstoppable at his best, but can be frustratingly inconsistent. Needs to work on his decision-making in the final third.
â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Mehdi Taremi (ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·) - 6/10</strong>
â€¢   A surprise inclusion. Decent finisher, but lacks the pace and skill to trouble top defenders. Overrated and a weak link in this attack.
â€¢   <strong>Attacker: Lionel Messi (ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·) - 9.5/10</strong>
â€¢   Still a magician, even in his twilight years. His vision, passing, and dribbling are unmatched. Not as explosive as he once was, but his footballing brain is still sharp.

<strong>In summary:</strong> This is a fun, attacking-minded team that will score goals. But they would leak goals just as easily and get destroyed by a well-organised team with a disciplined midfield.</div>
