  <h1>Description for Depeche_Mode_-_Violator.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's cut through the fluff and get to the real rankings, based on impact, consistency, and tactical innovation:

•   <strong>Alex Ferguson:</strong> 10/10. Undisputed king. Dominated for decades, built multiple title-winning squads, and instilled a winning mentality that was unmatched. Period.

•   <strong>Johan Cruyff:</strong> 9.5/10. Revolutionized football. His "Total Football" philosophy changed the game, and his influence extends beyond trophies to the very DNA of modern football.

•   <strong>Pep Guardiola:</strong> 9/10. Tactical genius. Has dominated in multiple leagues, but sometimes feels a bit too reliant on having the best players. Still, his impact is undeniable.

•   <strong>Arrigo Sacchi:</strong> 9/10. Another revolutionary. His AC Milan side was a machine, and his high-pressing, zonal-marking system was years ahead of its time.

•   <strong>Carlo Ancelotti:</strong> 8.5/10. A master of man-management. Wins everywhere he goes, but sometimes relies more on player quality than tactical innovation.

•   <strong>Jürgen Klopp:</strong> 8/10. High-energy, charismatic, and tactically astute. Has built incredible teams, but his style can be exhausting and hasn't always translated to sustained dominance.

•   <strong>Jose Mourinho:</strong> 7.5/10. A tactical pragmatist and master of the dark arts. Effective, but his style is often negative and his personality can be toxic. His peak was high, but his recent performances have been underwhelming.

•   <strong>Marcello Lippi:</strong> 7/10. Solid and dependable. Won consistently, but his teams weren't always the most exciting to watch.

•   <strong>Vicente del Bosque:</strong> 6.5/10. Inherited great teams and kept them winning. Not a tactical innovator, but a steady hand.

•   <strong>Arsene Wenger:</strong> 6/10. Revolutionized English football with his emphasis on diet and fitness, but his later years were marked by decline and a lack of tactical flexibility.

•   <strong>Diego Simeone:</strong> 5/10. Defensive mastermind, but his style is often too negative and reliant on physicality. Great for underdogs, but struggles to break down stubborn defenses.

•   <strong>Jupp Heynckes:</strong> 4/10. A good manager, but a bit overrated. His Bayern Munich side was impressive, but he benefited from having a stacked squad.</div>
