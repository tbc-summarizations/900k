  <div class="discord-text">Subject: Regarding Your BigCode Usage - Immediate Action Required

Henry,

Your BigCode usage is out of control. You're hitting the 50-use daily limit, and frankly, that's unacceptable. This isn't a free-for-all; you're impacting the resources available to everyone else.

What exactly are you doing with BigCode that requires such excessive usage? Are you using it for something you shouldn't be? Because if your activity is even remotely suspicious, inappropriate, or detrimental to the company in any way, you'll be facing serious consequences.

I need a clear explanation of your usage patterns immediately. Cut back on whatever it is you're doing until we have a chance to review this. If you can't provide a valid justification, expect restrictions on your access.

This is not a request; it's a demand. Consider this your final warning.</div>
