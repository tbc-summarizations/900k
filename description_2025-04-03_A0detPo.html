  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the FIFA rankings:

1.  <strong>Argentina:</strong> No surprises here. They won the World Cup. End of story. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.
2.  <strong>Spain:</strong> Overrated. They play boring possession football with no end product. They got lucky to be so high.
3.  <strong>France:</strong> Should probably be higher. Losing the World Cup final is a shame, but they are a force to be reckoned with.
4.  <strong>England:</strong> Typical England. Always hyped, always underperform.
5.  <strong>Brazil:</strong> Used to be the kings, now they're just a decent team. Neymar is overrated.
6.  <strong>Netherlands:</strong> Boring team, plays boring football. A bit too high in my opinion.
7.  <strong>Portugal:</strong> Heavily reliant on Ronaldo, but they can still win.
8.  <strong>Belgium:</strong> Golden generation is gone. Time to move on.
9.  <strong>Italy:</strong> Missed out on the World Cup. How are they even this high?
10. <strong>Germany:</strong> A shadow of their former glory. Disgraceful.
11. <strong>Croatia:</strong> Respect for consistently reaching the late stages in tournaments.
12. <strong>Morocco:</strong> Deservedly high after that World Cup run.
13. <strong>Uruguay:</strong> Past their prime. Nothing special.
14. <strong>Colombia:</strong> Who cares?
15. <strong>Japan:</strong> Always decent, never great.
16. <strong>United States:</strong> Overrated garbage.
17. <strong>Mexico:</strong> Can't even beat the US. Sad.
18. <strong>Iran:</strong> Lol.
19. <strong>Senegal:</strong> Okay for an African team.
20. <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Mediocre.
21. <strong>Denmark:</strong> Solid team.
22. <strong>Austria:</strong> Who cares?
23. <strong>South Korea:</strong> Son is carrying the team.
24. <strong>Ecuador:</strong> Okay.
25. <strong>Ukraine:</strong> Okay.
26. <strong>Australia:</strong> Decent for their region.
27. <strong>Turkey:</strong> Overhyped by their fans.
28. <strong>Sweden:</strong> Used to be good. Now they're just Zlatan-less.
29. <strong>Wales:</strong> Bale is finished.
30. <strong>Canada:</strong> Okay.
31. <strong>Serbia:</strong> Okay.
32. <strong>Egypt:</strong> Mo Salah is the only reason they are here.
33. <strong>Panama:</strong> Who cares?
34. <strong>Poland:</strong> Lewandowski can't do everything himself.
35. <strong>Russia:</strong> Banned from everything.
36. <strong>Algeria:</strong> Okay.
37. <strong>Hungary:</strong> Okay.
38. <strong>Norway:</strong> Haaland is great, the rest of the team isn't.
39. <strong>Czechia:</strong> Who cares?
40. <strong>Greece:</strong> Used to be relevant.
41. <strong>Ivory Coast:</strong> Okay.
42. <strong>Peru:</strong> Who cares?
43. <strong>Nigeria:</strong> Okay.
44. <strong>Scotland:</strong> Not even top 40 worthy.
45. <strong>Romania:</strong> Who cares?
46. <strong>Slovakia:</strong> Who cares?
47. <strong>Venezuela:</strong> Who cares?
48. <strong>Paraguay:</strong> Who cares?
49. <strong>Tunisia:</strong> Okay.
50. <strong>Cameroon:</strong> Okay.

Overall, the rankings are a joke as always. FIFA's system is flawed and favors certain teams. The only thing that really matters is who wins the tournaments.</div>
