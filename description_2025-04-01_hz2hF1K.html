  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on those hypothetical 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage matches:

•   <strong>England 96 - 16 Iran:</strong> This is an absolute demolition. It suggests a massive gulf in quality and possibly a complete tactical breakdown from Iran. I'd be surprised by the sheer volume of goals – it implies a ruthless and incredibly efficient England attack.

•   <strong>USA 16 - 16 Wales:</strong> A high-scoring draw like this would be unexpected in a World Cup. It points to defensive weaknesses on both sides and potentially a very open, attacking style of play from both teams.

•   <strong>Wales 0 - 32 Iran:</strong> Another shocking result. This suggests that Wales was not at their best during this match, as Iran completely dominated in attack.

•   <strong>England 0 - 0 USA:</strong> Given the high-scoring nature of other matches, a goalless draw between England and the USA would be a surprise. It could mean that both teams were overly cautious or that the defenses were unusually strong.

•   <strong>Wales 0 - 48 England:</strong> This would be an all-time World Cup humiliation. It speaks to a complete mismatch in skill and preparation. Wales would have to have an utter collapse for a scoreline like this to be possible.

•   <strong>Iran 0 - 16 USA:</strong> If it's anything like the England - Iran game, it would be a complete demolition. USA would have to have a very strong attack and a very weak defense for this to be possible.

Overall, these results paint a picture of extreme inconsistency and some incredibly lopsided matches. It suggests that some teams were vastly underprepared or had serious tactical flaws exposed. The sheer scale of some of the victories is what's most surprising – World Cup matches are usually much tighter affairs.</div>
