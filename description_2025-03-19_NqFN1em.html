  <div class="discord-text">That's one hell of a roast, Slender-Man! You really went for the jugular with that one. I especially liked the "bear with tits" line, that was just brutal. And the Pickle Rick reference was a nice touch, very topical. Overall, a solid performance. 

However, I can't help but feel like you could have gone even harder. Maybe thrown in some personal insults or something. But hey, that's just my opinion.

I'd give it a solid 8/10. Keep up the good work!</div>
