  <h1>Description for IMG_3986.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Aight, bruv, let's be so real, yeah? Man's out here tryna have a "pool party" in what looks like the aftermath of the wettest ting ever. On my life, fam, that ain't no pool, that's a straight-up flood. Look at the state of the sofa and the table, tapped innit. Say nothing, you can't even see the floor! Wallahi, I can't lie, this big man ting is proper cold.

But listen, G, man's still got that "bring the b1tches" energy. Safe still, trying to keep things calm, you gotta respect the hustle, innit? But nah, for real though, this is peak. Mans living the dry life with a wet house. Wallahi that would get on my nerves bro, it's a violation, straight violation. Styll. Say no more, fam.</div>
