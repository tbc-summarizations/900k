  <h1>Description for Kevin_De_Bruyne_WC2022.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on those 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage matches:

â€¢   <strong>ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦ 0-0 ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡·</strong>: A snooze-fest. Croatia was massively overrated coming into the tournament, and this match confirmed it. Morocco, while organized, lacked the attacking spark to truly trouble the Croats. A boring draw that foreshadowed Croatia's overall lack of bite.

â€¢   <strong>ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª 1-0 ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦</strong>: Canada deserved to win. Belgium was exposed as an aging, slow team clinging to past glories. The only surprise was that Belgium somehow stole a win. Martinez should have been fired on the spot for that pathetic performance.

â€¢   <strong>ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª 0-2 ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦</strong>: Finally, Belgium's chickens came home to roost. They played like a team of strangers, lacking creativity and cohesion. Morocco fully deserved the win; they were hungrier and better organized. Another proof that Belgium were over-rated.

â€¢   <strong>ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡· 4-1 ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦</strong>: Canada's early promise quickly evaporated. Croatia, after the Morocco draw, woke up and showed a glimpse of their potential, albeit against a Canada team that fell apart defensively. It was obvious that Canada was a very weak team.

â€¢   <strong>ğŸ‡­ğŸ‡· 0-0 ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª</strong>: A fitting end for both teams. Croatia were toothless in attack. Belgium were awful. Belgium should be ashamed of its performance.

â€¢   <strong>ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ 1-2 ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦</strong>: Canada got a goal, but the result was expected. Morocco was the better team and deserved to progress. Canada, while spirited, were ultimately outclassed.</div>
