  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking of the albums, from worst to best, with scores:

1.  <strong>Drake - $ome $exy Songs 4 U:</strong> 1/10. This is Drake at his absolute worst, phoning it in with lazy lyrics and uninspired beats.
2.  <strong>Playboi Carti - MUSIC:</strong> 2/10. Carti's sound has just become way too monotonous. I don't know how people listen to this uninspired trash.
3.  <strong>Lady Gaga - MAYHEM:</strong> 3/10. This is where Gaga sold out and went for the most generic pop sound she could find. It's a tragedy.
4.  <strong>The Weeknd - Hurry Up Tomorrow:</strong> 4/10. Another sellout who chose to lose the art of what made him special to get more money.
5.  <strong>Bad Bunny - DeBÍ TIRAR MÁS FOTOS:</strong> 5/10. This album is a mess. It feels like a collection of half-baked ideas thrown together, lacking any cohesion or direction.
6.  <strong>Oklou - choke enough:</strong> 6/10. This album has a few moments of brilliance, but it's ultimately held back by its lack of focus and inconsistent songwriting. It's an alright listen, but not one I'd revisit often.
7.  <strong>JPEGMAFIA - I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU:</strong> 7/10. This one is interesting, but JPEGMAFIA's style can be grating. It's chaotic and abrasive, which can be a lot to handle.
8.  <strong>Ethel Cain - Perverts:</strong> 7.5/10. It's well-produced and atmospheric, but it relies a little too much on shock value. Still, it's a solid effort.
9.  <strong>Mac Miller - Balloonerism:</strong> 8/10. A great album from a great artist. Rest in peace.
10. <strong>FKA twigs - EUSEXUA:</strong> 9/10. This album is an absolute masterpiece. FKA twigs pushes boundaries with her experimental sound and deeply personal lyrics. A must-listen.
11. <strong>clipping. - Dead Channel Sky:</strong> 9.5/10. This album is disturbing and brilliant. Clipping. blends noise, horror, and rap into something truly unique. It's not for everyone, but those who appreciate experimental music will love this.
12. <strong>青葉市子 \[Ichiko Aoba] - Luminescent Creatures:</strong> 10/10. I can't believe I found this album only now. What a masterpiece and nothing short of that.</div>
