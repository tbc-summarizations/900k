  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into these albums:

1.  <strong>Bob Dylan - Bob Dylan:</strong> Looks like someone took a candid shot of a confused teenager who wandered into a guitar store and doesn't know how he got there. The critics are being generous with a 78; they must have been bribed with harmonica lessons. And 972 people actually gave this a decent user score? Are they all tone-deaf or just blinded by the "folk legend" status?
2.  <strong>The Beach Boys - Surfin' Safari:</strong> The album cover looks like a low-budget vacation photo shoot gone wrong. It's got everything: a goofy-looking car, surfboards precariously balanced on top, and expressions of "are we there yet?" from the band. Critics seem to agree, with a measly 50. 51 is too high a user score, these people must have nostalgia goggles on tight.
3.  <strong>Adolf Hitler - Strawberry Birds Are Racist:</strong> I see why it's given a 100 by both critics and users. It is simply a masterpiece.</div>
