  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up, because I have some <em>strong</em> opinions on this:

<strong>From the Absolute Worst to the Most Divine (Music-Wise):</strong>

1.  <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Let's be honest, yodeling and techno-neutrality don't exactly scream "musical powerhouse."
2.  <strong>Qatar:</strong> Wealthy country, but its traditional music is bland and forgettable. Their music doesn't have much that makes them stand out.
3.  <strong>Wales:</strong> Not a fan of wales music, sounds really unoriginal.
4.  <strong>Saudi Arabia:</strong> Traditional music is, predictably, a snore. Modern pop? Exists, but let's be real, it's trying way too hard to be something it isn't.
5.  <strong>Iran:</strong> The music is weird and honestly not appealing.
6.  <strong>Cameroon:</strong> Bland and unmemorable. It all sounds the same, sadly.
7.  <strong>Tunisia:</strong> It is just bad, simple as that.
8.  <strong>Canada:</strong> I said what I said. Lots of pop stars, sure, but nothing that makes me go "Canada has a sound!"
9.  <strong>Ecuador:</strong> I would not listen to their music if you paid me.
10. <strong>Australia:</strong> I hate their music. It's some of the worst I've ever heard.
11. <strong>Poland:</strong> I don't like poland music and it would not catch my attention.
12. <strong>Denmark:</strong> Fine, but not great. Gets points for Aqua's "Barbie Girl" for pure chaotic energy. But beyond that? Meh.
13. <strong>Senegal:</strong> Has potential, but the production quality often lets it down.
14. <strong>Costa Rica:</strong> Doesn't stand out at all compared to its Latin American neighbors.
15. <strong>Croatia:</strong> There's some good stuff in the traditional realm, but modern Croatian music is uninspired.
16. <strong>Morocco:</strong> It is boring and mid.
17. <strong>South Korea:</strong> K-Pop is aggressively manufactured and overproduced. I am not convinced this will withstand time.
18. <strong>England:</strong> It is too generic and not very good, there is a lot of better stuff from other countries.
19. <strong>Netherlands:</strong> DJ's ruin all music from netherlands
20. <strong>Serbia:</strong> Very cool. There is much more that could be done
21. <strong>Belgium:</strong> I don't enjoy Belgian music, simple as that.
22. <strong>Germany:</strong> Techno and metal have their place, but German pop music is... a choice.
23. <strong>Ghana:</strong> Some of the highlife music is awesome, but a lot of it is not interesting.
24. <strong>Portugal:</strong> I'm not a fan of it as it feels cheap to me.
25. <strong>United States:</strong> Way too diverse to give a single ranking. They have fantastic genres and then there are horrible genres. I'll split it down the middle.
26. <strong>Japan:</strong> Some of it is pretty good, it has a lot of bad that turns me away from it though.
27. <strong>Uruguay:</strong> Tango and cumbia are a good base. Deserves some respect.
28. <strong>Mexico:</strong> A rich musical heritage, but modern Mexican music can be a bit repetitive and predictable.
29. <strong>France:</strong> Can't deny the legacy of French pop. Some truly iconic singers.
30. <strong>Spain:</strong> Flamenco is amazing, and Spanish pop has some bangers. Overall pretty good.
31. <strong>Argentina:</strong> Tango is incredible, and Argentinian rock is fantastic. A country with deep musical passion.
32. <strong>Brazil:</strong> Samba, bossa nova, MPB... Brazil has a musical soul that's undeniable. The rhythm, the melodies, the sheer joy... it's unmatched.

There you have it. My unfiltered, brutal, and utterly subjective musical rankings. Don't @ me. I stand by my choices.</div>
