  <div class="discord-text">These results are absolutely pathetic, a total joke.

•   <strong>England 1536-256 Iran:</strong> A crushing victory that raises expectations sky-high, only for the team to flounder later. Classic overconfidence trap.
•   <strong>USA 256-256 Wales:</strong> A lackluster draw. Typical American grit but no real cutting edge. Wales showed spirit, but overall disappointing for both sides.
•   <strong>Wales 0-512 Iran:</strong> A shameful defeat for Wales. No passion, no fight. Iran capitalized on the Welsh weakness, but Wales handed it to them on a silver platter.
•   <strong>England 0-0 USA:</strong> A snooze-fest. England choked, couldn't break down a determined but ultimately limited American defense. USA celebrated a draw like a victory – speaks volumes.
•   <strong>Wales 0-768 England:</strong> A total humiliation for Wales. They should be ashamed of themselves. England finally showed some ruthlessness, but it came against a team that had already given up.
•   <strong>Iran 0-256 USA:</strong> Another dull match. Iran showed some defensive resilience, but offered nothing in attack. USA scraped through, but it was hardly convincing.

Overall, this group stage was a massive letdown. England showed flashes of brilliance but lacked consistency. The USA was uninspiring but somehow managed to progress. Wales was an utter embarrassment. Iran had moments of fight but ultimately lacked the quality to challenge. A truly forgettable showing.</div>
