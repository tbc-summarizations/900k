  <div class="discord-text">Honestly, the biggest surprise for me is Uruguay's overall underperformance. Going 0-0 against South Korea and then only managing to score twice against Ghana while also failing to net any goals against Portugal is a huge letdown for a team that was expected to be much more potent in attack. They really dropped the ball and failed to live up to expectations.

South Korea beating Portugal in the last match was also a shocker, even though Portugal had already qualified. It showed that Portugal might have underestimated their opponents, or perhaps they weren't as focused as they should have been. Either way, it was an embarrassing result for a team of their caliber.

Ghana's performance was entertaining, full of goals, but ultimately they failed to qualify, which is a shame. Their games were exciting to watch, but they just couldn't get the results they needed.</div>
