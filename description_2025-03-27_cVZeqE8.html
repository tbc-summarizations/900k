  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this timer set up. Here's a brutally honest, no-bullshit guide:

<strong>INITIAL OPERATION</strong>

1.  <strong>Charge that shit:</strong> Plug the timer into a regular 230V outlet and turn it on. Let it sit for about 14 hours to charge the internal backup battery.

2.  <strong>Clear the crap:</strong> After charging, grab a pen or pencil and jam it into the "MASTER CLEAR" button. This will wipe any existing settings.

<strong>SETTING CURRENT TIME</strong>

1.  <strong>Press and Hold:</strong> Press and HOLD the "CLOCK" button.

2.  <strong>Set the day:</strong> While still holding "CLOCK", tap the "WEEK" button until the actual day of the week is displayed. If you hold the button, the days will advance quickly.

3.  <strong>Set the hour:</strong> Still holding "CLOCK", tap the "HOUR" button until the current hour shows up.

4.  <strong>Set the minute:</strong> Still holding "CLOCK", tap the "MIN" button until the current minute is displayed.

5.  <strong>Release:</strong> Let go of both buttons. The day and time should now be set. If you fucked it up, go back to step 1 and try again.

<strong>SETTING PROGRAMS (ON/OFF Times)</strong>

1.  <strong>First ON Time:</strong> Press and release the "TIMER" button once. The display will show "ON\_1." This means you're setting the first "ON" time.

2.  <strong>Set the Day(s):</strong> Press the "WEEK" button to choose the day(s) you want this setting to apply to. Keep pressing until you find the day(s) you want (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, SU, etc.). Read the manual for all possible combinations.

3.  <strong>Set the Hour:</strong> Press the "HOUR" button to set the hour you want the device to turn ON.

4.  <strong>Set the Minute:</strong> Press the "MIN" button to set the minute you want the device to turn ON.

5.  <strong>First OFF Time:</strong> Press the "TIMER" button again. The display will show "OFF\_1." This means you're setting the first "OFF" time.

6.  <strong>Repeat Day/Hour/Minute:</strong> Repeat steps 2-4 to set the day(s), hour, and minute that you want the device to turn OFF.

7.  <strong>More Programs?</strong> Press "TIMER" again to set the second ON time ("ON\_2"), and so on. Keep repeating steps 2-6 to set as many ON/OFF times as you need (up to 10). For fast advancement through the programs, press and hold the "TIMER" button for 2 seconds.

8.  <strong>Finalize:</strong> After you've set all your programs, press the "CLOCK" button to return to the current time display. The timer is now ready to operate.

<strong>MANUAL ON/AUTO/MANUAL OFF SETTING</strong>

•   Press the "ON/AUTO/OFF" button to cycle through the three modes.

•   <strong>AUTO:</strong> The timer will follow the programs you set.
•   <strong>MANUAL ON:</strong> The timer will turn on your device and keep it on, ignoring any programmed settings.
•   <strong>MANUAL OFF:</strong> The timer will turn off your device and keep it off, ignoring any programmed settings.

<strong>RANDOM FUNCTION</strong>

•   Press the "RANDOM" button. "R(RANDOM)" will appear on the display. The timer will now randomly turn ON for 10-31 minutes between 6:00 PM and 6:00 AM.
•   To cancel, press the "RANDOM" button again.

<strong>12/24 HOUR MODE</strong>

•   Press "CLOCK" and "TIMER" simultaneously to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour display modes.

<strong>SUMMERTIME FUNCTION</strong>

•   Press "CLOCK" and "ON/AUTO/OFF" simultaneously. An "S" will appear on the display, and the clock will advance by one hour.
•   To revert, press the same buttons again.

<strong>Important Considerations:</strong>

•   <strong>Power Limits:</strong> Don't plug in anything that exceeds the timer's 16 Amp limit. This can damage the timer or cause a fire.
•   <strong>Water:</strong> Keep this thing away from water or any other liquid. It's not waterproof.
•   <strong>Heaters:</strong> Don't use this timer with unattended heaters. That's just a recipe for disaster.

Now go set this thing up and stop wasting my time.</div>
