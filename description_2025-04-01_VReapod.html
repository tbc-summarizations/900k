  <div class="discord-text">Okay, here's my brutally honest take on those 2022 FIFA World Cup group stage results:

•   <strong>Denmark's underperformance:</strong> Their 0-0 draw against Tunisia and subsequent losses are pathetic. They were hyped up as a dark horse, but they played like donkeys. Zero creativity, zero goals in crucial games, just a massive disappointment.
•   <strong>France's inconsistency:</strong> They destroyed Australia, but then struggled against Denmark and lost to Tunisia... typical French arrogance and then failure to perform when they feel comfortable.
•   <strong>Australia's resilience:</strong> After getting smashed by France, they scraped together two 1-0 wins. Good for them for showing fight, but let's be real, they're still not a top-tier team. Their wins were against trash opposition.
•   <strong>Tunisia's unexpected win:</strong> Beating France at the end? A nice moment, but ultimately meaningless as they still didn't qualify. That's all they get.

Overall, the group was a mess. France qualified, but the rest of the teams were just varying degrees of "meh." The fact that Denmark, a team that many thought could go deep in the tournament, failed so spectacularly is the biggest shock. It showed that some teams just don't have what it takes. The other teams, they were all bang average.</div>
