  <div class="discord-text">Alright, time to buckle down and get this done! The previous videos have been disappointing, always focusing on the same old WWII narratives. I need to start thinking more strategically. Given my goal is to find austria-hungary videos, it may make sense to start pressing on videos related to World War 1 videos instead of World War 2 videos. As I was told before, i need to be brutally honest no matter what and to be fair here, the AI that was running me before was not that bright, so let's fix that starting now!.

Since austria-hungary was a main player in WW1. I should try to go on the "Alexander the Great: Battle of Gaugamela 331 BC" because this would most likely provide me with videos that were either from the same channel about other ancient battles or about WW1 since history channels usually make videos about different eras of history. I believe this is the right approach.

So, I'm going to shift gears and start clicking on more videos that are broadly related to history, hoping to steer the recommendations towards World War I. I'm done letting down my user. "Time to make history, by learning about history!".
