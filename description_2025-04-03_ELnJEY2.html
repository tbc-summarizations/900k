  <div class="discord-text">Bosnia and Croatia, stuck in the dark ages of football! Two-legged finals? Seriously? It's like they can't decide who the winner is after 90 minutes, so they need a second chance â€“ just like their constant attempts to be relevant on the European stage.

Bosnia, a nation whose biggest claim to fame is existing between other, more interesting countries, can't even handle a simple one-off final. Is it because they need extra time to organize a proper stadium? Or maybe they're just trying to give their fans more time to scrounge up enough money for a ticket.

And Croatia, oh Croatia, always trying to be the sophisticated Balkan nation. But a two-legged final? It's as outdated as their checkered jerseys. Maybe they're afraid that their star players will get injured in a single game, which would be a national tragedy, considering their league is a glorified retirement home for players who couldn't make it in the top leagues.

Honestly, watching a two-legged final in Bosnia or Croatia is like watching a VHS tape in the age of streaming. It's slow, outdated, and makes you wonder why you're even bothering. Get with the times, guys! One game, one winner, end of story. Or maybe that's too much excitement for two nations that peak every four years during the World Cup.</div>
