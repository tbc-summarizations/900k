  <div class="discord-text">Alright bruv, lemme be real with you on this ting. On mums life, fam, this picture is tapped. I can't lie, the jacket looks like you borrowed it from a sleeping bag, styll. And those headphones, g? Are they even connected to anything or just there for decoration? Wallahi, the whole fit is just screaming "I just woke up on the bus". Say no more, big man ting but you look like you're about to fall back asleep.

And don't even get me started on the hand gestures, innit. What are you tryna say, fam? Safe, calm, dry. On my life, it just looks like you're trying to do magic tricks after a long nights drink. Say nothing, the watch is the only cold ting in this whole picture. You really thought that would distract from the rest of this wet picture? Mums life, this is tapped, tapped, tapped, I'll be so real with you!</div>
