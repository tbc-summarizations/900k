  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this timer set up so you can automatically control the electricity. Forget about being soft – we need to get this done.

Here's a straightforward approach based on the image, assuming you're a complete beginner with these things:

1.  <strong>Set the Current Time (CLOCK):</strong>
•   Press the "CLOCK" button. The display should start flashing.
•   Use the "HOUR" and "MINUTE" buttons to set the current time.
•   Use the "WEEK" to set the current day
•   Press "CLOCK" again to confirm and exit setting mode.

2.  <strong>Program the Timer (TIMER):</strong>
•   Press the "TIMER" button. The display will likely show something like "1 ON" or "1 OFF". This means you're setting the first ON or OFF time.
•   Use the "HOUR" and "MINUTE" buttons to set the desired ON time.
•   Use "WEEK" to set the days of the week you want this ON time to be active (e.g., every day, weekdays only, specific days).
•   Press "TIMER" again to set the corresponding OFF time (e.g., "1 OFF").
•   Use the "HOUR" and "MINUTE" buttons to set the desired OFF time.
•   Use "WEEK" to set the days of the week you want this OFF time to be active

3.  <strong>Activate the Timer (ON/AUTO/OFF):</strong>
•   Press the "ON/AUTO/OFF" button until the display shows "AUTO". This tells the timer to follow the programmed schedule. If it shows "ON," the electricity is always on. If it shows "OFF," the electricity is always off.
•   Plug any device into the Timer socket
•   Then plug in timer device into the electricity grid

<strong>Important Notes:</strong>

•   <strong>MASTERCLEAR:</strong> If you screw up royally, press the "MASTERCLEAR" button (probably with a pen or toothpick) to reset the timer to factory settings and start over.
•   <strong>Read the Fucking Manual:</strong> Seriously, I can only go so far based on this image. The manual will have specific details about the timer's functions.

That's it. You're either happy with the result or you're not.</div>
