  <h1>Description for Red_Ball_Walkthrough_Video_All_Levels_1-17.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, buckle up for a world where those infamous figures never graced (or rather, disgraced) the timeline. Here's how things could shake out:

•   <strong>20th &amp; 21st-Century Politics:</strong> Without Hitler and the Nazis, World War II is averted or significantly altered. No Holocaust, meaning a vastly different Jewish demographic globally. A less divided Europe, perhaps a quicker or more peaceful formation of the EU. No Stalin to steer the Soviet Union, leading to a potentially less repressive communist regime or its outright collapse. No Mao, so China’s trajectory avoids the Cultural Revolution and Great Leap Forward – potentially leading to earlier economic and political liberalization. Reagan's absence could have a profound impact on late 20th Century economics and the Cold War. Without the "War on Terror" led by Bin Laden, global security policies and travel regulations would look vastly different, likely less intrusive. And of course, there will be no Putin to start the Ukraine war.

•   <strong>Social and Cultural Landscape:</strong> Without the Joker, Michael Myers, Pennywise, Slenderman, Jigsaw, Death, Voldemort, Satan, Thanos, The Zodiac Killer, Walter White, and William Afton, there is less cultural fascination with villains and monsters. Horror and suspense genres might take entirely different forms or be less popular. There may not even be a Darth Vader without one. There's a chance fewer kids get scared after they hear some kind of new ghost story.

•   <strong>Crime and Justice:</strong> Without the drug empire of Pablo Escobar, many South American countries experience different power dynamics and levels of violence. Jeffrey Epstein’s non-existence would spare many victims from sexual abuse and alter elite social circles. Derek Chauvin's absence could mean an easier path for racial equity. Ted Bundy and other serial killers' lack of existence is obvious.

•   <strong>Civil Rights and Equality:</strong> With no Jefferson Davis or Nathan Bedford Forrest, the American South's history unfolds with potentially less resistance to racial equality post-Civil War. Civil rights advancements might come sooner and with less bloodshed.

•   <strong>Morality and Ethics:</strong> No Pol Pot to cause a "killing field" in Cambodia. Vlad The Impaler, or Vlad Dracul to torture innocent villagers and impale them on stakes.

Overall, we're talking about a world with potentially less overt evil and violence in its history. Whether that leads to genuine utopia or simply shifts the landscape for other conflicts and problems is up for debate.</div>
