  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break down how to min-max this "AURA Infiltration - The Nitro Quest" and grab that digital crack (Nitro). I'm assuming you want the most straightforward, least risky path to success:

<strong>1. Get the Invite (Fastest Route):</strong>

•   <strong>Start Scene:</strong> Choose "Scan the digital alleys for clues about an invite." (Infiltration Level 1)
•   <strong>scan\_alleys Scene:</strong> Focus on "Estonian memes". Choose "Focus on 'Estonian memes'. Try invite codes like 'tervitused' or 'eesti'."
•   <strong>try\_invite\_meme Scene:</strong> When prompted for the invite code, type the following into your browser: discord.gg/tere

<strong>2. Bypassing Security Question:</strong>

•   <strong>try\_invite\_meme Scene:</strong> Take the only option, "Proceed to verification.". You're now at the 'verification\_gate' scene.
•   <strong>verification\_gate Scene:</strong> Choose the following answer: enter 'I GOTCHU BRO' (Condition should not matter as you are forcing it, so take either one.).

<strong>3. In The Group:</strong>

•   <strong>verification\_success Scene:</strong> You are in with 0 game knowledge. Take the only available option, "Observe the chat."

<strong>4. First Impression:</strong>

•   <strong>lurking\_observe Scene:</strong> Now, make your first impression! Select "Make your first post: Compliment Meeth's generosity."
•   <strong>post\_compliment\_meeth Scene:</strong> Make your first reply. Choose "Reply: 'Thanks Meeth! Happy to be here.'"

<strong>5. Continue Impression</strong>

•   <strong>intro\_reply\_positive Scene:</strong> Engage with the AURA. Select, "Look for opportunities to help members.".

<strong>6. Secure AURA</strong>

•   <strong>find\_help\_opportunity Scene:</strong> Offer help to Frank. Select "Offer to look at Frank's art."
•   <strong>help\_frank\_art Scene:</strong> Say you are going to help Frank! The art sucks but give "vague but positive-sounding advice". Choose "Continue participating.".

<strong>7. Leverage Frank:</strong>

•   <strong>help\_frank\_art Scene:</strong> Now that you helped Frank and built the most vital trust, Choose "Specifically try to leverage this favor with Frank.".
•   <strong>leverage\_frank Scene:</strong> Time to probe. Choose "Thank Frank and return to general chat."

<strong>8. Ready Up:</strong>

•   <strong>leverage\_frank Scene:</strong> Check if it is time to ask. Select "Yes, I feel ready. Make the ask." <strong>CONDITION GATEKEEPS HERE. IF UNABLE, GO BACK AND FOLLOW MIN-MAX GAMEPLAY AGAIN</strong>

<strong>9. Make the ask:</strong>

•   You got it. Read the chat and get your Nitro bro.

<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This playthrough skips a lot of nuance, relies heavily on the "I GOTCHU BRO" bypass, and leverages one specific member (Frank). There are other ways to play, build broader trust, and get the Nitro more organically. This path prioritizes speed and minimal risk while still accounting for the fact that your character needs to say things or build SOME type of relationship to even progress in the game.</div>
