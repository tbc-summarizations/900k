  <h1>Description for 2025-04-03_00-52-24.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect this abysmal "Vape Simulator" game so you can recreate it. Brace yourself, it's not pretty.

<strong>Overall Game Structure:</strong>

This is a basic choice-based "simulator" with multiple endings. It relies on shock value and juvenile humor, particularly centered around the principal character. The game consists of a single environment and one interactable character.

<strong>Detailed Outline</strong>

1.  <strong>Splash Screen:</strong>
•   The game starts with a Unity logo and the name of the developer, "Meethexep Games." This is cheap and amateurish.

2.  <strong>Main Menu:</strong>
•   <strong>Background:</strong> A poorly rendered brick wall texture that is probably a downloaded image.
•   <strong>Title:</strong> "Vape Simulator."
•   <strong>Character:</strong> A stick figure with a smiley face head, holding a vape. It looks like a child drew it.
•   <strong>Options:</strong>
•   Play
•   Quit
•   Credits (lists "Antonn" for the menu song and "HenryTheKazakh" for the pause button)

3.  <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
•   <strong>Environment:</strong> A generic, uninspired school hallway. Again, likely a downloaded image.
•   <strong>Character:</strong> Your stick figure smiley face, standing in the hallway.
•   <strong>Story Start:</strong> Text bubble: "Man, I haven't vaped in a few hours..."
•   <strong>Next Action:</strong> Text bubble: "I'm gonna go vape."
•   <strong>Vaping Choice:</strong> Two buttons appear:
•   Vape
•   Full Vape
•   Clicking either causes the stick figure to "vape" with a crude visual effect. Rapidly selecting either will lead to Overdose Ending

4.  <strong>Principal Encounter</strong>
•   The principal appears and then runs towards character
•   Choice-based system:
•   Go through the hall
•   Run away
•   <strong>Go through the hall</strong> ends with a "Caught Ending". spam clicking, ends with the Nerd ending.

<strong>Endings and How to Get Them:</strong>

•   <strong>Overdose Ending (Bad):</strong> Continuously clicking either "Vape" or "Full Vape" one after another.
•   <strong>Description:</strong> "You vaped too much and passed out."
•   <strong>Caught Ending (Bad):</strong> Select Run away and fail to spam click.
•   <strong>Description:</strong> "You ran too slow and the principal managed to press the emergency button"
•   <strong>Good Ending (Okay):</strong> Select "Run away" and spam click to escape.
•   <strong>Description:</strong> "You managed to run away from the principal. You got caught, so there will be future issues..."
•   <strong>Nerd Ending (Good):</strong> Select Go through the hall and spam click.
•   <strong>Description:</strong> "You were smart and knew that it was illegal for the principal to view your pockets without a proper reason"

<strong>Details to Note for Your Remake</strong>

•   <strong>Visuals:</strong> Need a complete overhaul. The stick figures and downloaded images are unacceptable.
•   <strong>Story/Humor:</strong> It's based on childish concepts and shock value. Unless that's your explicit goal, rewrite it entirely.

To summarize: This game has some fundamental flaws, it's the lack of effort and quality. As you recreate it, your priority should be fixing these issues to make an impressive game.</div>
