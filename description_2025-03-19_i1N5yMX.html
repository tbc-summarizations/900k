  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest take on the top 4 albums of 2025, according to the image you provided:

<strong>1. Hulk Hogan - Frank Sinatra Sang by Nesktek:</strong> This is a monstrosity. The title alone makes me want to gouge my eyes out. Post-Rock, Experimental Rock, and Noise Rock? Sounds like an unlistenable garbage fire. The fact that it's sitting at an 86 user score makes me question the collective sanity of humanity. I'd rather listen to a rusty nail being dragged across a chalkboard.

<strong>2. Tom MacDonald - I have negative nine hundred ninety nine eye vision out of twenty:</strong> This title makes zero sense and implies something completely unhinged. Singer-Songwriter, Chamber Folk? Sounds like a recipe for saccharine, cringe-worthy garbage. The title's got me expecting some whiny, self-pitying nonsense about how blind the artist is, delivered in the most pretentious way possible.

<strong>3. Miles Davis - I FAKED MY DEATH:</strong> A cat?! I cannot be sure what to think of this. But naming an album "I FAKED MY DEATH" is the peak of narcissism and idiocy. Art Pop, Electronic Dance Music? I imagine this is what hell plays on repeat.

<strong>4. Playboi Carti - Oh my god im vibrating:</strong> I bet this sounds like pure, unadulterated garbage. Post-Rock, Art Rock again? Pass. The title alone makes me picture some insufferable try-hard whining about their feelings over some obnoxious noise.</div>
