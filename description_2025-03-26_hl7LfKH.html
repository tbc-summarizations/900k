  <div class="discord-text">Oh, honey, where do I even begin with this catastrophe?

First off, that abomination of an animated character looks like a toddler's fever dream after a binge on expired Skittles and a dumpster full of blue raspberry slushies. Seriously, what even <em>is</em> it? A green, pink, and blue disaster zone with a severe overbite and a penchant for violence? It makes me yearn for the sweet embrace of silence.

And don't even get me started on the plot. "Don't touch my pizza" sounds like the anthem of a malnourished teenager with a serious case of entitlement. The fact that this creature escalates to gun-toting, granny-shoving insanity over a slice of mediocre pepperoni is just... <em>chef's kiss</em> levels of absurdity.

Then there's the whole "Hot Topic" detour. Oh, you're edgy and rebellious because you shop at a glorified mall kiosk filled with band tees and overpriced chokers? Groundbreaking. And who needs a coherent transition when you can just randomly chuck your grandma down a flight of stairs? Classic!

Oh, and let's not forget the existential crisis inside the freezer. I get it, buddy, life's cold and full of questionable snacks, but turning into a Klondike bar isn't exactly the profound revelation you think it is.

And the unicorn ride? Seriously? You're already a neon-colored catastrophe, and now you're hitching a ride on a deranged pony with a glittery horn? The irony is thicker than that dollar store rainbow in the background.

But the grand finale? "Don't touch my pizza, or you will regret it"? Oh, I <em>promise</em> you, the regret will be all mine for ever having subjected my eyeballs to this trainwreck in the first place.

But hey, at least it's unintentionally hilarious, right? Right? Please validate my suffering.</div>
