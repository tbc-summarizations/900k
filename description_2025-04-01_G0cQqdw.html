  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my brutally honest ranking and scoring of those albums, worst to best.

1.  <strong>¥$ - VULTURES 1</strong> - 1/10: This album is utter trash. Kanye's descent into madness is fully realized here. The production is lazy, the lyrics are offensively dumb, and the whole thing reeks of desperation. 

2.  <strong>Future - WE DON'T TRUST YOU</strong> - 3/10: Overlong, repetitive, and utterly devoid of any originality. Future and Metro Boomin phoned this one in. It's like they're actively trying to bore the listener.

3.  <strong>Kendrick Lamar - GNX</strong> - 4/10: I don't know if this album really exists or not, but if it does, it will suck ass, because I don't know Kendrick made GNX.

4.  <strong>Billie Eilish - HIT ME HARD AND SOFT</strong> - 5/10: This album is boring, but not extremely bad. I wouldn't listen to it again unless I was forced.

5.  <strong>Taylor Swift - THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT</strong> - 6/10: Taylor Swift is just boring. This album is a bland attempt to seem deep and poetic, and it falls flat. The songwriting is mediocre, and her voice is grating after a while. 

6.  <strong>Charli XCX - BRAT</strong> - 6/10: Pretty much every album I've heard from her is a hit or miss, and usually very annoying.

7.  <strong>¥$ - VULTURES 2</strong> - 7/10: I don't even know if it released. If it did, it doesn't really matter as the first album sucks anyway.

8.  <strong>Quadeca - SCRAPYARD</strong> - 7/10: Not great not terrible.

9.  <strong>Magdalena Bay - Imaginal Disk</strong> - 8/10: An interesting sound I really appreciate, not anything groundbreaking but good.

10. <strong>Geordie Greep - The New Sound</strong> - 9/10: Some real experimental stuff. It's definitely a unique album.

11. <strong>JPEGMAFIA - I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU</strong> - 9/10: Pure, unadulterated chaos in the best way possible. JPEGMAFIA's production is abrasive and innovative, and his lyrics are a mix of humor and rage. 

12. <strong>Tyler, The Creator - CHROMOKOPIA</strong> - 10/10: Whatever album Tyler is making, it will probably be one of the best of his career, as Tyler is an amazing artist who can do no wrong.</div>
