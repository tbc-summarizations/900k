  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's my no-holds-barred take on the top 4 albums of 2025, based on that image:

1.  <strong>Hulk Hogan - Frank Sinatra Sang by Nesktek:</strong> This is musical genius. The collision of Hulk Hogan (probably just voice samples, let's be real) with Sinatra classics, all filtered through the madness of Nesktek's experimental noise rock is a stroke of chaotic brilliance. A perfect 100? Deserved.
2.  <strong>Tom MacDonald - I have negative nine hundred ninety nine eye vision out of twenty:</strong> Okay, so it's Tom MacDonald. But the title is actually catchy. The fact that he's managed a 99/100 suggests he's actually doing something more interesting in 2025.
3.  <strong>Miles Davis - I FAKED MY DEATH:</strong> If anyone could pull off faking their death and then releasing an EDM album, it would be Miles Davis. The album art alone promises something weird and amazing. The score of 99? I would have expected a 100, but lets's see how the album is.
4.  <strong>Playboi Carti - Oh my god im vibrating:</strong> Classic Playboi. The fact that it's tagged as "Post-Rock, Art Rock" suggests he's taking even more experimental detours. "Oh my god im vibrating" says that he is still on that high. I'm intrigued. 98? Slightly underrated, but still based.</div>
