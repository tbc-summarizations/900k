  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's dissect "Ellington Uptown." First off, the album cover looks like a rejected design for a 1950s laundromat. Duke Ellington, floating disembodied in that yellow circle, looks like he's just realized he left the iron on.

The title itself, "Ellington Uptown," screams of a band trying too hard to be hip and sophisticated. Like they just discovered they can play above 125th Street. And, let's be honest, if your user score is lower than your critic score, you're not connecting with the people who actually listen to music. It's like throwing a party and only the snobby critics show up. So, congratulations Duke, you managed to impress a couple of reviewers. Big whoop.

Overall, this album gives the impression of a band past their prime, trying too hard to stay relevant. Stick to the classics, Duke. This "Uptown" experiment is just embarrassing.</div>
