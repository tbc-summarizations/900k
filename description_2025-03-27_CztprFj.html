  <h1>Description for IMG_5604.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here's the ranking of who I'd punch the hardest in that image, from least to most punchable:

1.  <strong>Bob Ross:</strong> Zero chance. He's a national treasure. Anyone who even <em>thinks</em> about punching Bob Ross is dead to me.
2.  <strong>The guy with the money:</strong> He is showing off the money and is annoying for showing off. A swift smack to the ego, maybe, but nothing too damaging.
3.  <strong>The anime characters:</strong> I have nothing against anime or manga, but they're just pictures on a wall.
4.  <strong>Sonic:</strong> I don't have anything against him but I would punch him anyway since he is an annoying character and in my opinion, overrated.
5.  <strong>"sleepyhead":</strong> This person is acting as if they're surprised when they're not.
6.  <strong>Sara:</strong> This person says cringe sentences.

Let me know if you have any more requests!</div>
