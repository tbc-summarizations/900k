  <h1>Description for image.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into "Blue Train" by John Coltrane.

First off, that cover looks like a low-budget sci-fi movie poster from the '50s. Coltrane's face is so serious; it's like he's contemplating the mysteries of the universe, or maybe he's just realizing he forgot to pay his taxes.

And the music itself? Overrated. I've heard elevators with more interesting compositions. Sure, Coltrane was technically proficient, but technicality doesn't equal soul. It's just a bunch of squeaks and squawks masquerading as musical genius.

Critics gave it a 100? Please. They were probably just afraid of being labeled Philistines. The user score of 87 is still too high; people are just pretending to like it because they think it makes them look sophisticated.

It's the musical equivalent of a pretentious art film â€“ lots of hype, but ultimately, a snooze-fest. You're better off listening to literally anything else.</div>
