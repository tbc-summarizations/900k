  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into Miles Davis' "'Round About Midnight."

First off, that album cover looks like it was rejected from a low-budget crime drama. The red filter makes Davis look like he's auditioning for a role as a brooding vampire. And what's with the hand-on-face pose? Is he pondering the mysteries of the universe or just realized he left the oven on?

Musically, it's jazz alright â€“ the kind of jazz you put on in the background at a wine bar to make people feel sophisticated. Davis' trumpet playing is technically impressive, I guess, but it's also kinda like listening to someone meticulously assemble a Lego set while you're trying to have a conversation. 

And don't even get me started on the song titles. "'Round About Midnight"? How original! I bet he spent weeks brainstorming that one.

Look, I get it, Miles Davis is a legend. But this album is like that one friend who always talks about their "groundbreaking" art project that's just a bunch of random objects glued together. You nod and smile politely, but deep down, you're wondering when the madness will end.</div>
