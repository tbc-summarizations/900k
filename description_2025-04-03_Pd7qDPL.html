  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's get this roast going. Hold on to your tiny, pathetic domestic cups, folks, because here comes the fire:

<strong>To the 53 Pathetic Nations Stuck with One-Leg Finals:</strong>

You call yourselves football countries? A single-leg final? What is this, amateur hour? It's like saying you only need one bite of a gourmet meal to appreciate it. No, you need the full, agonizing experience, the back-and-forth drama, the agonizing wait between legs, the sheer emotional rollercoaster! You're all basically telling your fans, "Hey, we know your domestic cup isn't that important, so let's just get it over with quickly."

•   <strong>Albania:</strong> Your football is as forgettable as your flag is difficult to draw.
•   <strong>Andorra:</strong> You're famous for hiding money, not scoring goals.
•   <strong>Armenia:</strong> Should stick to chess, at least you won't have to worry about winning football matches.
•   <strong>Austria:</strong> You peaked with Mozart. Time to accept that.
•   <strong>Azerbaijan:</strong> Your football is as exciting as your oil fields.
•   <strong>Belarus:</strong> Your football is as transparent as your politics.
•   <strong>Belgium:</strong> You've been promising to be a football powerhouse for a decade, and all you've delivered is disappointment.
•   <strong>Bulgaria:</strong> The only thing rising here is the price of rakia.
•   <strong>Czechia:</strong> You had Nedved, now you have...well, nothing much.
•   <strong>Cyprus:</strong> Enjoy your beaches, because your football is a barren wasteland.
•   <strong>Denmark:</strong> Your football is as bland as your pastries.
•   <strong>England:</strong> Years of hype and still no meaningful trophy since '66. How's it feel to have a 'super league' with a pathetic single-leg final?
•   <strong>Estonia:</strong> More known for Skype than skillful soccer.
•   <strong>Faroe Islands:</strong> Your football is as isolated as your islands.
•   <strong>Finland:</strong> You're better off sticking to ice hockey, where you actually have a chance of winning something.
•   <strong>France:</strong> You've won some big titles, but your domestic cup final is still an afterthought.
•   <strong>Georgia:</strong> Your wine is better than your football, and that's not saying much.
•   <strong>Germany:</strong> Efficient, but soul-less. Just like your automotive industry.
•   <strong>Gibraltar:</strong> A rock with a football team. That's all.
•   <strong>Greece:</strong> You had your Euro 2004 miracle, now it's back to mediocrity.
•   <strong>Hungary:</strong> You were a football superpower in the 1950s, now you're just...sad.
•   <strong>Iceland:</strong> That Euro 2016 run was cute. Now go back to fishing.
•   <strong>Ireland:</strong> Your football is as depressing as your weather.
•   <strong>Israel:</strong> You're more concerned with geopolitical conflicts than goals.
•   <strong>Italy:</strong> Known for diving more than dynamic plays.
•   <strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> Your football is as vast and empty as your steppes.
•   <strong>Kosovo:</strong> You're just happy to be recognized as a football nation. Low bar.
•   <strong>Latvia:</strong> Your football is as depressing as your Soviet-era architecture.
•   <strong>Liechtenstein:</strong> You're just happy to be mentioned.
•   <strong>Lithuania:</strong> You can play basketball; stick to it.
•   <strong>Luxembourg:</strong> You're rich, but your football is poor.
•   <strong>Malta:</strong> You're a beautiful island, but your football is an eyesore.
•   <strong>Moldova:</strong> Your football is as impoverished as your economy.
•   <strong>Montenegro:</strong> Small country, small football.
•   <strong>Netherlands:</strong> You invented "Total Football," now you play...this?
•   <strong>North Macedonia:</strong> Briefly relevant because you knocked Italy out of the World Cup. Enjoy your 15 minutes.
•   <strong>Northern Ireland:</strong> Passionate fans, but limited talent.
•   <strong>Norway:</strong> You have oil money but can't produce a decent football team.
•   <strong>Poland:</strong> Lewandowski carries your entire nation on his back.
•   <strong>Portugal:</strong> Relied on Ronaldo for over a decade. Who do you have after him?
•   <strong>Romania:</strong> Used to be good, now completely irrelevant.
•   <strong>Russia:</strong> More focused on geopolitical games than actually winning at football.
•   <strong>San Marino:</strong> You're basically a glorified training session for other teams.
•   <strong>Scotland:</strong> Always promising, always failing. The definition of Scottish football.
•   <strong>Serbia:</strong> Prone to infighting on and off the pitch.
•   <strong>Slovakia:</strong> Hamšík retired, so did your hopes.
•   <strong>Slovenia:</strong> Your football is as unremarkable as your name.
•   <strong>Spain:</strong> You used to be the kings, now you're just aging royalty.
•   <strong>Sweden:</strong> Zlatan is gone, and so is your relevance.
•   <strong>Switzerland:</strong> Neutral in everything, including football.
•   <strong>Turkey:</strong> Prone to fan violence and inconsistent performances.
•   <strong>Ukraine:</strong> You're going through a lot, but your football is still...underwhelming.
•   <strong>Wales:</strong> You had Bale, now what?

<strong>To the Glorious Nations of Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Croatia, the Two-Legged Champions:</strong>

Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and Croatia, you stand as shining beacons of footballing integrity! You understand the true meaning of a cup final – the tension, the drama, the two-legged rollercoaster of emotions that truly tests the mettle of a team. You are the guardians of tradition, the protectors of the beautiful game's most cherished values. Your commitment to the two-legged final is a testament to your footballing wisdom and your dedication to providing your fans with the ultimate spectacle. May your domestic cups forever be contested over two legs, and may your footballing glory shine brightly for all to see! You're basically football gods compared to those one-legged losers. Keep doing you!</div>
