  <h1>Description for i_matched_with_george_floyd_on_tinder_after_his_death_i_barely_espaced_with_my_life.mp4</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">The video presents a story told from the perspective of a man who identifies as a sigma male, who has a strong hatred for black people. He uses Tinder to make fake profiles using pictures of black people he went to school with, with the intention of luring them out to his home to rob them. One day, he makes a profile with George Floyd, and somehow matches with the account. When he messages the George Floyd account, the message is where the white women are at. The man responds by saying right here king. And giving out his address. The man hears the account rummaging through his kitchen and finds that it's the spirit of George Floyd. George Floyd then attacks him and the man only escapes because his roommate Ronnie Mcnutt ends up killing George Floyd.

The story is intentionally offensive and uses explicit racial slurs to express hatred. The violent and disturbing elements, combined with the disrespectful use of George Floyd's death, make it highly disturbing and unsettling. The idea of a deceased person returning with supernatural abilities to seek revenge is a horror trope, but here it is used in a way that feels intentionally hateful.</div>
