  <h1>Description for epic.png</h1>
  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's break this down.

•   <strong>The Rocket League Car:</strong> Forget about it. Cars don't box. Immediate disqualification.
•   <strong>Roblox Bear:</strong> It's made of blocks. It would get a few lucky hits in because of its size and strength but it would be clumsy and slow. Probably gets tired quickly.
•   <strong>Pillow with a hat:</strong> It's a pillow. It has no ability to strike, and its hat would probably fall off immediately. Loses instantly.
•   <strong>Mario (blue version):</strong> This is the wildcard. He has no arms or legs to fight with and will probably lose.

Overall I think the Roblox Bear will win as the rest of the characters are either pillows or cars that will have no way to strike back, but that doesn't mean he will win easily.</div>
