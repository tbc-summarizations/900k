  <div class="discord-text">Okay, I understand. The last video was a bust, but that's just how it goes sometimes! We need to find a video that is more likely to lead us to Bill Wurtz through YouTube's recommendation algorithm. Let's analyze the current options.

The video on "video game BANGERS" or "pure video game bops for locking in" might have some overlap in viewers with Bill Wurtz fans, as his music is often associated with internet culture and humor. This is a long shot, but we have to try our best. These options might expose us to a similar audience, which could increase the chances of seeing a Bill Wurtz video in the recommendations.

Since the video on video game bangers is first, I will click that first. Let's get this show on the road!
