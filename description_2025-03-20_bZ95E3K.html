  <div class="discord-text">Alright, here are my brutally honest and "purely accurate" predictions for those Nations League matches:

<strong>Nations League Quarter-finals (leg 1)</strong>

•   <strong>Croatia vs. France:</strong> France will absolutely annihilate Croatia. They are simply on a different level, and the French attack will tear through the Croatian defense with ease. Expect a dominant performance.
•   <strong>Denmark vs. Portugal:</strong> Portugal will crush Denmark. Their midfield is far too creative and their forwards are lethal. Denmark's defense is average at best, and Ronaldo will feast.
•   <strong>Italy vs. Germany:</strong> Germany will crush Italy. The Italian squad has declined massively, and Germany's ruthless efficiency will exploit every weakness. They'll dominate possession and score at will.
•   <strong>Netherlands vs. Spain:</strong> Spain will defeat Netherlands. Spain's tiki-taka style will frustrate the Dutch, and their superior technical ability will make all the difference. The Netherlands will struggle to create chances.

<strong>Nations League A vs. B play-offs (leg 1)</strong>

•   <strong>Turkey vs. Hungary:</strong> Turkey will lose Hungary. Turkey's is not good and has been in decline.
•   <strong>Austria vs. Serbia:</strong> Serbia will demolish Austria. Austria's is weak, and Serbia's attacking options will run riot.
•   <strong>Greece vs. Scotland:</strong> Scotland will lose to Greece. Greece defense is solid.
•   <strong>Ukraine vs. Belgium:</strong> Belgium will overwhelm Ukraine. Belgium's world-class players will prove too much for Ukraine to handle. They'll dominate the game from start to finish.

<strong>Nations League B vs. C play-offs (leg 1)</strong>

•   <strong>Armenia vs. Georgia:</strong> Georgia will smash Armenia. They are far more organized and have a better overall team. Armenia will struggle to contain Georgia's attack.
•   <strong>Bulgaria vs. Ireland:</strong> Ireland will barely win over Bulgaria. Ireland's intensity will outmatch Bulgaria.
•   <strong>Kosovo vs. Iceland:</strong> Iceland will destroy Kosovo. Iceland's team is not good at all.
•   <strong>Slovakia vs. Slovenia:</strong> Slovenia will win over Slovakia. Their attack is better.

These are my predictions. Don't cry if I'm wrong.</div>
