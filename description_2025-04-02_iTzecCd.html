  <div class="discord-text">Based on the information provided, here's a brutally honest prediction for the Atletico Madrid vs. Barcelona Copa del Rey semi-final leg 2:

<strong>Prediction: Atletico Madrid 3-1 Barcelona (Atletico Madrid win 7-5 on aggregate)</strong>

<strong>Reasoning:</strong>

•   <strong>Home Advantage:</strong> The Civitas Metropolitano is a cauldron. Simeone's Atletico are a different beast at home, known for their intensity, tactical discipline, and ability to grind out results. Barcelona will struggle to cope with the pressure.

•   <strong>Atletico's Tactical Shift:</strong> Simeone abandoning the 5-4-1 from the first leg for a 4-4-2 signals intent. He wants to attack Barcelona and exploit their defensive weaknesses. The midfield pairing of Barrios and De Paul will be more dynamic, allowing Llorente and Simeone to provide width and support the in-form Alvarez and Griezmann.

•   <strong>Barcelona's Defensive Frailties:</strong> Barcelona's defense is a mess. Cubarsi and Martinez are young and inexperienced. Kounde is error-prone, and Balde is not a natural defender. Atletico's direct attacking style will expose these weaknesses repeatedly. Szczesny in goal is not exactly prime Neuer either.

•   <strong>Midfield Battle:</strong> Atletico's midfield, with De Paul's creativity and Barrios' tenacity, will outwork and outmuscle Barcelona's. De Jong is a good player, but he can't carry the entire midfield on his own. Pedri is inconsistent and Lopez lacks the experience to handle the pressure of a semi-final.

•   <strong>Barcelona's Attack Lack Luster:</strong> Ferran Torres up front is not going to cut it. He lacks the killer instinct and clinical finishing needed in a game of this magnitude. Raphinha is talented but inconsistent, and Yamal is still too young to be relied upon to deliver in such a high-stakes match. The lack of Lewandowski from the start is a massive blow.

•   <strong>Simeone's Masterclass:</strong> Simeone will set up his team perfectly to frustrate Barcelona, exploit their defensive vulnerabilities on the counter-attack, and win the midfield battle. He's a master of these types of games.

<strong>Score Prediction Breakdown:</strong>

•   Atletico Madrid: Alvarez will score early, Griezmann will add another before halftime, and Llorente will seal the deal with a late goal on the counter.
•   Barcelona: A late consolation goal from a set piece or a moment of individual brilliance.

<strong>In conclusion,</strong> Atletico Madrid is the clear favorite for this game. They're more motivated, better organized, and have a tactical advantage over a defensively fragile and creatively limited Barcelona side. Expect a dominant performance from Atletico in front of their home fans.</div>
