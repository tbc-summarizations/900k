  <div class="discord-text">Alright, let's tear into "Chet Baker Sings."

Chet Baker, the James Dean of jazz, except instead of rebelling, he just sounded perpetually sleepy. This album? It's basically a masterclass in how to make melancholy sound like a pleasant nap. 

His voice? It's like he's singing from a cloud made of cotton balls and heroin. It's so delicate you're half expecting him to break into tears at any moment. The trumpet playing isn't too much better, he plays the instrument like he has never really learned how.

And let's be honest, the "sings" part of the title is generous. It's more like he's whispering sweet nothings to a microphone while trying to remember the lyrics. It's music to stare at the ceiling to, while contemplating your own mediocre existence. If you're looking for jazz with some actual energy, steer clear of this one, or else listen to it just for the sheer novelty of hearing a dude sleepwalk through a whole album.</div>
